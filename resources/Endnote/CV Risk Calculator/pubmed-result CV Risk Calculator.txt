TI  - Framingham-based tools to calculate the global risk of coronary heart
      disease: a systematic review of tools for clinicians.
PG  - 1039-52
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the features of available Framingham-based risk
      calculation tools and review their accuracy and feasibility in clinical
      practice. DATA SOURCES: medline, 1966-April 2003, and the google search
      engine on the Internet. TOOL AND STUDY SELECTION: We included risk
      calculation tools that used the Framingham risk equations to generate a
      global coronary heart disease (CHD) risk. To determine tool accuracy, we
      reviewed all articles that compared the performance of various
      Framingham-based risk tools to that of the continuous Framingham risk
      equations. To determine the feasibility of tool use in clinical practice,
      we reviewed articles on the availability of the risk factor information
      required for risk calculation, subjective preference for 1 risk calculator
      over another, or subjective ease of use. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers
      independently reviewed the results of the literature search, all websites,
      and abstracted all articles for relevant information. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      Multiple CHD risk calculation tools are available, including risk charts
      and computerized calculators for personal digital assistants, personal
      computers, and web-based use. Most are easy to use and available without
      cost. They require information on age, smoking status, blood pressure,
      total and HDL cholesterol, and the presence or absence of diabetes.
      Compared to the full Framingham equations, accuracy for identifying
      patients at increased risk was generally quite high. Data on the
      feasibility of tool use was limited. CONCLUSIONS: Several easy-to-use
      tools are available for estimating patients' CHD risk. Use of such tools
      could facilitate better decision making about interventions for primary
      prevention of CHD, but further research about their actual effect on
      clinical practice and patient outcomes is required.

TI  - Prediction of coronary heart disease using risk factor categories.
PG  - 1837-47
AB  - BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to examine the association of
      Joint National Committee (JNC-V) blood pressure and National Cholesterol
      Education Program (NCEP) cholesterol categories with coronary heart
      disease (CHD) risk, to incorporate them into coronary prediction
      algorithms, and to compare the discrimination properties of this approach
      with other noncategorical prediction functions. METHODS AND RESULTS: This
      work was designed as a prospective, single-center study in the setting of
      a community-based cohort. The patients were 2489 men and 2856 women 30 to
      74 years old at baseline with 12 years of follow-up. During the 12 years
      of follow-up, a total of 383 men and 227 women developed CHD, which was
      significantly associated with categories of blood pressure, total
      cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, and HDL cholesterol (all P<.001).
      Sex-specific prediction equations were formulated to predict CHD risk
      according to age, diabetes, smoking, JNC-V blood pressure categories, and
      NCEP total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol categories. The accuracy of
      this categorical approach was found to be comparable to CHD prediction
      when the continuous variables themselves were used. After adjustment for
      other factors, approximately 28% of CHD events in men and 29% in women
      were attributable to blood pressure levels that exceeded high normal (> or
      =130/85). The corresponding multivariable-adjusted attributable risk
      percent associated with elevated total cholesterol (> or =200 mg/dL) was
      27% in men and 34% in women. CONCLUSIONS: Recommended guidelines of blood
      pressure, total cholesterol, and LDL cholesterol effectively predict CHD
      risk in a middle-aged white population sample. A simple coronary disease
      prediction algorithm was developed using categorical variables, which
      allows physicians to predict multivariate CHD risk in patients without
      overt CHD.

TI  - Application of Framingham risk estimates to ethnic minorities in United
      Kingdom and implications for primary prevention of heart disease in
      general practice: cross sectional population based study.
PG  - 1271
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To compare the 10 year risk of coronary heart disease (CHD),
      stroke, and combined cardiovascular disease (CVD) estimated from the
      Framingham equations. DESIGN: Population based cross sectional survey.
      SETTING: Nine general practices in south London. POPULATION: 1386 men and
      women, age 40-59 years, with no history of CVD (475 white people, 447
      south Asian people, and 464 people of African origin), and a subgroup of
      1069 without known diabetes, left ventricular hypertrophy, peripheral
      vascular disease, renal impairment, or target organ damage. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: 10 year risk estimates. RESULTS: People of African origin had
      the lowest 10 year risk estimate of CHD adjusted for age and sex (7.0%,
      95% confidence interval 6.5 to 7.5) compared with white people (8.8%, 8.2
      to 9.5) and south Asians (9.2%, 8.6 to 9.9) and the highest estimated risk
      of stroke (1.7% (1.5 to 1.9), 1.4% (1.3 to 1.6), 1.6% (1.5 to 1.8),
      respectively). The estimate risk of combined CVD, however, was highest in
      south Asians (12.5%, 11.6 to 13.4) compared with white people (11.9%, 11.0
      to 12.7) and people of African origin (10.5%, 9.7 to 11.2). In the
      subgroup of 1069, the probability that a risk of CHD >/=15% would identify
      risk of combined CVD >/=20% was 91% in white people and 81% in both south
      Asians and people of African origin. The use of thresholds for risk of CHD
      of 12% in south Asians and 10% in people of African origin would increase
      the probability of identifying those at risk to 100% and 97%,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Primary care doctors should use a lower
      threshold of CHD risk when treating mild uncomplicated hypertension in
      people of African or south Asian origin.

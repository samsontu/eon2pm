TI  - Automated extraction of ejection fraction for quality measurement using regular
      expressions in Unstructured Information Management Architecture (UIMA) for heart 
      failure.
PG  - 859-66

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Left ventricular ejection fraction (EF) is a key component of heart
      failure quality measures used within the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). Our 
      goals were to build a natural language processing system to extract the EF from
      free-text echocardiogram reports to automate measurement reporting and to
      validate the accuracy of the system using a comparison reference standard
      developed through human review. This project was a Translational Use Case Project
      within the VA Consortium for Healthcare Informatics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We
      created a set of regular expressions and rules to capture the EF using a random
      sample of 765 echocardiograms from seven VA medical centers. The documents were
      randomly assigned to two sets: a set of 275 used for training and a second set of
      490 used for testing and validation. To establish the reference standard, two
      independent reviewers annotated all documents in both sets; a third reviewer
      adjudicated disagreements. RESULTS: System test results for document-level
      classification of EF of <40% had a sensitivity (recall) of 98.41%, a specificity 
      of 100%, a positive predictive value (precision) of 100%, and an F measure of
      99.2%. System test results at the concept level had a sensitivity of 88.9% (95%
      CI 87.7% to 90.0%), a positive predictive value of 95% (95% CI 94.2% to 95.9%),
      and an F measure of 91.9% (95% CI 91.2% to 92.7%). DISCUSSION: An EF value of
      <40% can be accurately identified in VA echocardiogram reports. CONCLUSIONS: An
      automated information extraction system can be used to accurately extract EF for 
      quality measurement.

TI  - Willingness to pay in dermatology: assessment of the burden of skin diseases.
PG  - 1785-90
LID - 10.1038/jid.2012.50 [doi]
AB  - Willingness to pay (WTP) is a monetary, preference-based, burden-of-disease
      measure with a potential role in dermatology, where many conditions are temporary
      and/or mild, and many treatments are inexpensive and one might be able to imagine
      paying out of pocket. We assessed construct validity by interviewing 254
      consecutive dermatology patients at Stanford Medical Center, Grady Hospital, and 
      Parkland Hospital. Instruments asked about an individual's own health status and 
      elicited WTP, time-trade-off (TTO) utilities, and health status quality of life
      (QOL). We measured WTP cure (short treatment course to eliminate disease) and WTP
      control (lifelong medication). Our data indicate greater construct validity in
      non-Medicaid (n=163) than Medicaid (n=91) patients. Non-Medicaid subjects had
      greater WTP as percent of income for cure (median: 2%) than control (median:
      1.6%), P<0.01; Medicaid WTP amounts for control and cure did not differ.
      Non-Medicaid subjects with verrucae had little QOL impact, no measurable burden
      by TTO, and a correspondingly low WTP. Medicaid subjects with basal cell
      carcinoma had a strong, negative QOL impact and high burden by TTO, but had
      relatively moderate WTP. WTP appears promising in certain income categories. More
      studies are needed for conclusions about specific diagnoses.

TI  - A clinically guided approach for improving performance measurement for
      hypertension.
PG  - 399-405
LID - 10.1097/MLR.0b013e318245a147 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Performance measures often fail to account for legitimate reasons why
      patients do not achieve recommended treatment targets. METHODS: We tested a novel
      performance measurement system for blood pressure (BP) control that was designed 
      to mimic clinical reasoning. This clinically guided approach focuses on (1)
      exempting patients for whom tight BP control may not be appropriate or feasible
      and (2) assessing BP over time. Trained abstractors conducted structured chart
      reviews of 201 adults with hypertension in 2 VA health care systems. Results were
      compared with traditional methods of performance measurement. RESULTS: Among 201 
      veterans, 183 (91%) were male, and the mean age was 71+/-11 years. Using the
      clinically guided approach, 61 patients (30%) were exempted from performance
      measurement. The most common reasons for exemption were inadequate opportunity to
      manage BP (35 patients, 17%) and the use of 4 or more antihypertensive
      medications (19 patients, 9%). Among patients eligible for performance
      measurement, there was little agreement on the presence of controlled versus
      uncontrolled BP when comparing the most recent BP (the traditional approach) with
      an integrated assessment of BP control (kappa 0.14). After accounting for
      clinically guided exemptions and methods of BP assessment, only 15 of 72 patients
      (21%) whose last BP was >/=140/90 mm Hg were classified as problematic by the
      clinically guided approach. CONCLUSIONS: Many patients have legitimate reasons
      for not achieving tight BP control, and the methods used for BP assessment have
      marked effects on whether a patient is classified as having adequate or
      inadequate BP control.

TI  - Knowing loved ones' end-of-life health care wishes: attachment security predicts 
      caregivers' accuracy.
PG  - 814-8
LID - 10.1037/a0025664 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: At times, caregivers make life-and-death decisions for loved ones. Yet
      very little is known about the factors that make caregivers more or less accurate
      as surrogate decision makers for their loved ones. Previous research suggests
      that in low stress situations, individuals with high attachment-related anxiety
      are attentive to their relationship partners' wishes and concerns, but get
      overwhelmed by stressful situations. Individuals with high attachment-related
      avoidance are likely to avoid intimacy and stressful situations altogether. We
      hypothesized that both of these insecure attachment patterns limit surrogates'
      ability to process distressing information and should therefore be associated
      with lower accuracy in the stressful task of predicting their loved ones'
      end-of-life health care wishes. METHOD: Older patients visiting a medical clinic 
      stated their preferences toward end-of-life health care in different health
      contexts, and surrogate decision makers independently predicted those
      preferences. For comparison purposes, surrogates also predicted patients'
      perceptions of everyday living conditions so that surrogates' accuracy of their
      loved ones' perceptions in nonstressful situations could be assessed. RESULTS:
      Surrogates high on either type of insecure attachment dimension were less
      accurate in predicting their loved ones' end-of-life health care wishes. It is
      interesting to note that even though surrogates' attachment-related anxiety was
      associated with lower accuracy of end-of-life health care wishes of their loved
      ones, it was associated with higher accuracy in the nonstressful task of
      predicting their loved ones' everyday living conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Attachment 
      orientation plays an important role in accuracy about loved ones' end-of-life
      health care wishes. Interventions may target emotion regulation strategies
      associated with insecure attachment orientations.

PG  - 1589-95
LID - 10.1111/j.1532-5415.2011.03542.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: To estimate the potentially inappropriate use of implantable
      cardioverter-defibrillator ICDs in older U.S. adults. DESIGN: Retrospective
      study. SETTING: The National Cardiovascular Data ICD Registry. PARTICIPANTS:
      Forty-four thousand eight hundred five individuals in the National Cardiovascular
      Data's ICD Registry() who had received ICDs for primary prevention from January
      2006 to December 2008. Individuals with a prior myocardial infarction and
      ejection fraction less than 30% were included. MEASUREMENTS: Mortality risk was
      categorized using the Multicenter Automatic Defibrillator Implantation (MADIT) II
      risk-stratification system. Low-risk and very-high-risk individuals were
      considered potentially inappropriate recipients. RESULTS: Of 44,805 individuals, 
      67% (n = 29,893) were aged 65 and older, of whom 51% were aged 75 and older. A
      significant proportion of ICD recipients had a low risk of death (16%, n = 6,969)
      or very high risk of nonarrhythmic death (8%, n = 3,693). Potentially
      inappropriate ICD use was 10% in those aged 75 and older, much less than in
      younger groups (40%, <65; 21%, 65-74, P < .001). Although age was associated with
      a high risk of nonarrhythmic death, its influence was markedly attenuated after
      adjusting for comorbidities and timing of ICD implantation (odds ratio = 1.02,
      95% confidence interval = 1.02-1.03, P < .001). CONCLUSION: Potentially
      inappropriate ICD use appears significantly less--and at modest rates--in older
      Americans than in younger age groups. Overall, almost one-quarter of individuals 
      may have received ICDs inappropriately based on their risk of death. Physicians
      appear to be conservatively referring older adults and wisely deferring those
      with high comorbid burden.

TI  - Influence of age on perioperative complications among patients undergoing
      implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for primary prevention in the United
      States.
PG  - 549-56
LID - 10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.110.959205 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND- The majority of current implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) 
      recipients are significantly older than those in the ICD trials. Data on
      periprocedural complications among the elderly are insufficient. We evaluated the
      influence of age on perioperative complications among primary prevention ICD
      recipients in the United States. METHODS AND RESULTS- Using the National
      Cardiovascular Data's ICD Registry, we identified 150 264 primary prevention
      patients who received ICDs from January 2006 to December 2008. The primary end
      point was any adverse event or in-hospital mortality. Secondary end points
      included major adverse events, minor adverse events, and length of stay. Of 150
      264 patients, 61% (n=91 863) were 65 years and older. A higher proportion of
      patients >/=65 years had diabetes, congestive heart failure, atrial fibrillation,
      renal disease, and coronary artery disease. Approximately 3.4% of the entire
      cohort had any complication, including death, after ICD implant. Any adverse
      event or death occurred in 2.8% of patients under 65 years old; 3.1% of 65- to
      69-year-olds; 3.5% of 70- to 74-year-olds; 3.9% of 75- to 79-year-olds, 4.5% of
      80- to 84-year-olds; and 4.5% of patients 85 years and older. After adjustment
      for clinical covariates, multivariate analysis found an increased odds of any
      adverse event or death among 75- to 79-year-olds (1.14 [95% confidence interval, 
      1.03 to 1.25], 80-to 84-year-olds (1.22 [95% confidence interval, 1.10 to 1.36], 
      and patients 85 years and older (1.15 [95% confidence interval, 1.01 to 1.32],
      compared with patients under 65 years old. CONCLUSIONS- Older patients had a
      modestly increased-but acceptably safe-risk of periprocedural complications and
      in-hospital mortality, driven mostly by increased comorbidity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To determine which of 3 interventions was most effective in improving
      blood pressure (BP) control, we performed a 4-arm randomized trial with 18-month 
      follow-up at the primary care clinics at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center.
      METHODS: Eligible patients were randomized to either usual care or 1 of 3
      telephone-based intervention groups: (1) nurse-administered behavioral
      management, (2) nurse- and physician-administered medication management, or (3) a
      combination of both. Of the 1551 eligible patients, 593 individuals were
      randomized; 48% were African American. The intervention telephone calls were
      triggered based on home BP values transmitted via telemonitoring devices.
      Behavioral management involved promotion of health behaviors. Medication
      management involved adjustment of medications by a study physician and nurse
      based on hypertension treatment guidelines. RESULTS: The primary outcome was
      change in BP control measured at 6-month intervals over 18 months. Both the
      behavioral management and medication management alone showed significant
      improvements at 12 months-12.8% (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6%-24.1%) and
      12.5% (95% CI, 1.3%-23.6%), respectively-but not at 18 months. In subgroup
      analyses, among those with poor baseline BP control, systolic BP decreased in the
      combined intervention group by 14.8 mm Hg (95% CI, -21.8 to -7.8 mm Hg) at 12
      months and 8.0 mm Hg (95% CI, -15.5 to -0.5 mm Hg) at 18 months, relative to
      usual care. CONCLUSIONS: Overall intervention effects were moderate, but among
      individuals with poor BP control at baseline, the effects were larger. This study
      indicates the importance of identifying individuals most likely to benefit from
      potentially resource intensive programs. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov

AB  - Radiology reports are unstructured free text documents that describe
      abnormalities in patients that are visible via imaging modalities such as X-ray. 
      The number of imaging examinations performed in clinical care is enormous, and
      mining large repositories of radiology reports connected with clinical data such 
      as patient outcomes could enable epidemiological studies, such as correlating the
      frequency of infections to the presence or length of time medical devices are
      present in patients. We developed a natural language processing (NLP) system to
      recognize device mentions in radiology reports and information about their state 
      (insertion or removal) to enable epidemiological research. We tested our system
      using a reference standard of reports that were annotated to indicate this
      information. Our system performed with high accuracy (recall and precision of 97%
      and 99% for device mentions and 91-96% for device insertion status). Our methods 
      are generalizable to other types of radiology reports as well as to other
      information extraction tasks and could provide the foundation for tools that
      enable epidemiological research exploration based on mining radiology reports.

      practice guidelines for opioid therapy for chronic pain.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/1748-5908-5-26 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Opioid prescribing for chronic pain is common and controversial, but 
      recommended clinical practices are followed inconsistently in many clinical
      settings. Strategies for increasing adherence to clinical practice guideline
      recommendations are needed to increase effectiveness and reduce negative
      consequences of opioid prescribing in chronic pain patients. METHODS: Here we
      describe the process and outcomes of a project to operationalize the 2003 VA/DOD 
      Clinical Practice Guideline for Opioid Therapy for Chronic Non-Cancer Pain into a
      computerized decision support system (DSS) to encourage good opioid prescribing
      practices during primary care visits. We based the DSS on the existing
      ATHENA-DSS. We used an iterative process of design, testing, and revision of the 
      DSS by a diverse team including guideline authors, medical informatics experts,
      clinical content experts, and end-users to convert the written clinical practice 
      guideline into a computable algorithm to generate patient-specific
      recommendations for care based upon existing information in the electronic
      medical record (EMR), and a set of clinical tools. RESULTS: The iterative
      revision process identified numerous and varied problems with the initially
      designed system despite diverse expert participation in the design process. The
      process of operationalizing the guideline identified areas in which the guideline
      was vague, left decisions to clinical judgment, or required clarification of
      detail to insure safe clinical implementation. The revisions led to workable
      solutions to problems, defined the limits of the DSS and its utility in clinical 
      practice, improved integration into clinical workflow, and improved the clarity
      and accuracy of system recommendations and tools. CONCLUSIONS: Use of this
      iterative process led to development of a multifunctional DSS that met the
      approval of the clinical practice guideline authors, content experts, and
      clinicians involved in testing. The process and experiences described provide a
      model for development of other DSSs that translate written guidelines into
      actionable, real-time clinical recommendations.

TI  - When tight blood pressure control is not for everyone: a new model for
      performance measurement in hypertension.
PG  - 164-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Many patients with hypertension have legitimate reasons to forego
      standard blood pressure targets yet are nonetheless included in performance
      measurement systems. An approach to performance measurement incorporating
      clinical reasoning was developed to determine which patients to include in a
      performance measure. DESIGN: A 10-member multispecialty advisory panel refined a 
      taxonomy of situations in which the balance of benefits and harms of
      anti-hypertensive treatment does not clearly favor tight blood pressure control
      (< 140/90 mm Hg). FINDINGS: The panel identified several broad categories of
      reasons for exempting a patient from performance measurement for blood pressure
      control. These included (1) patients who have suffered adverse effects from
      multiple classes of antihypertensive medications; (2) patients already taking
      four or more antihypertensive medications; (3) patients with terminal disease,
      moderate to severe dementia, or other conditions that overwhelmingly dominate the
      patient's clinical status; and (4) other patient factors, including comfort care 
      orientation and poor medication adherence despite attempts to remedy adherence
      difficulties. Several general principles also emerged. Performance measurement
      should focus on patients for whom the benefits of treatment clearly outweigh the 
      harms and should incorporate a longitudinal approach. In addition, the criteria
      for exempting a patient from performance measurement should be more strict in
      patients at higher risk of adverse health outcomes from hypertension and more
      lenient for patients at lower risk. CONCLUSIONS: Incorporating "real world"
      clinical principles and judgment into performance measurement systems may improve
      targeting of care and, by accounting for patient case mix, allow for better
      comparison of performance between institutions.

TI  - Evaluation of the acceptability and usability of a decision support system to

      primary care providers.
PG  - 575-85
LID - 10.1111/j.1526-4637.2010.00818.x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and evaluate a clinical decision support system (CDSS)
      named Assessment and Treatment in Healthcare: Evidenced-Based Automation
      (ATHENA)-Opioid Therapy, which encourages safe and effective use of opioid
      therapy for chronic, noncancer pain. DESIGN: CDSS development and iterative
      evaluation using the analysis, design, development, implementation, and
      evaluation process including simulation-based and in-clinic assessments of
      usability for providers followed by targeted system revisions. RESULTS:
      Volunteers provided detailed feedback to guide improvements in the graphical user
      interface, and content and design changes to increase clinical usefulness,
      understandability, clinical workflow fit, and ease of completing guideline
      recommended practices. Revisions based on feedback increased CDSS usability
      ratings over time. Practice concerns outside the scope of the CDSS were also
      identified. CONCLUSIONS: Usability testing optimized the CDSS to better address
      barriers such as lack of provider education, confusion in dosing calculations and
      titration schedules, access to relevant patient information, provider
      discontinuity, documentation, and access to validated assessment tools. It also
      highlighted barriers to good clinical practice that are difficult to address with
      CDSS technology in its current conceptualization. For example, clinicians
      indicated that constraints on time and competing priorities in primary care,
      discomfort in patient-provider communications, and lack of evidence to guide
      opioid prescribing decisions impeded their ability to provide effective,
      guideline-adherent pain management. Iterative testing was essential for designing
      a highly usable and acceptable CDSS; however, identified barriers may limit the
      impact of the ATHENA-Opioid Therapy system and other CDSS on clinical practices
      and outcomes unless CDSS are paired with parallel initiatives to address these
      issues.

TI  - Following your heart or your head: focusing on emotions versus information
      differentially influences the decisions of younger and older adults.
PG  - 87-95
LID - 10.1037/a0018500 [doi]
AB  - Research on aging has indicated that whereas deliberative cognitive processes
      decline with age, emotional processes are relatively spared. To examine the
      implications of these divergent trajectories in the context of health care
      choices, we investigated whether instructional manipulations emphasizing a focus 
      on feelings or details would have differential effects on decision quality among 
      younger and older adults. We presented 60 younger and 60 older adults with health
      care choices that required them to hold in mind and consider multiple pieces of
      information. Instructional manipulations in the emotion-focus condition asked
      participants to focus on their emotional reactions to the options, report their
      feelings about the options, and then make a choice. In the information-focus
      condition, participants were instructed to focus on the specific attributes,
      report the details about the options, and then make a choice. In a control
      condition, no directives were given. Manipulation checks indicated that the
      instructions were successful in eliciting different modes of processing. Decision
      quality data indicate that younger adults performed better in the
      information-focus than in the control condition whereas older adults performed
      better in the emotion-focus and control conditions than in the information-focus 
      condition. Findings support and extend extant theorizing on aging and decision
      making as well as suggest that interventions to improve decision-making quality
      should take the age of the decision maker into account.

AB  - The Morningside Initiative is a public-private activity that has evolved from an 
      August, 2007, meeting at the Morningside Inn, in Frederick, MD, sponsored by the 
      Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center (TATRC) of the US Army
      Medical Research Materiel Command. Participants were subject matter experts in
      clinical decision support (CDS) and included representatives from the Department 
      of Defense, Veterans Health Administration, Kaiser Permanente, Partners
      Healthcare System, Henry Ford Health System, Arizona State University, and the
      American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA). The Morningside Initiative was
      convened in response to the AMIA Roadmap for National Action on Clinical Decision
      Support and on the basis of other considerations and experiences of the
      participants. Its formation was the unanimous recommendation of participants at
      the 2007 meeting which called for creating a shared repository of executable
      knowledge for diverse health care organizations and practices, as well as health 
      care system vendors. The rationale is based on the recognition that sharing of
      clinical knowledge needed for CDS across organizations is currently virtually
      non-existent, and that, given the considerable investment needed for creating,
      maintaining and updating authoritative knowledge, which only larger organizations
      have been able to undertake, this is an impediment to widespread adoption and use
      of CDS. The Morningside Initiative intends to develop and refine (1) an
      organizational framework, (2) a technical approach, and (3) CDS content
      acquisition and management processes for sharing CDS knowledge content, tools,
      and experience that will scale with growing numbers of participants and can be
      expanded in scope of content and capabilities. Intermountain Healthcare joined
      the initial set of participants shortly after its formation. The efforts of the
      Morningside Initiative are intended to serve as the basis for a series of next
      steps in a national agenda for CDS. It is based on the belief that sharing of
      knowledge can be highly effective as is the case in other competitive domains
      such as genomics. Participants in the Morningside Initiative believe that a
      coordinated effort between the private and public sectors is needed to accomplish
      this goal and that a small number of highly visible and respected health care
      organizations in the public and private sector can lead by example. Ultimately, a
      future collaborative knowledge sharing organization must have a sustainable
      long-term business model for financial support.

TI  - Preferences for dialysis withdrawal and engagement in advance care planning
      within a diverse sample of dialysis patients.
PG  - 237-42
LID - 10.1093/ndt/gfp430 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Rates of dialysis withdrawal are higher among the
      elderly and lower among Blacks, yet it is unknown whether preferences for
      withdrawal and engagement in advance care planning also vary by age and race or
      ethnicity. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: We recruited 61
      participants from two dialysis clinics to complete questionnaires regarding
      dialysis withdrawal preferences in five different health states. Engagement in
      advance care planning (end-of-life discussions), completion of advance directives
      and 'do not resuscitate' or 'do not intubate' (DNR/DNI) orders were ascertained
      by a questionnaire and from dialysis unit records. RESULTS: The mean age was 62
      +/- 15 years; 38% were Black, 11% were Latino, 34% were White and 16% of
      participants were Asian. Blacks were less likely to prefer dialysis withdrawal as
      compared with Whites (odds ratio 0.16, 95% confidence interval 0.03-0.88) and
      other race/ethnicity groups, and this difference was not explained by age,
      education, comorbidity and other confounders. In contrast, older age was not
      associated with preferences for withdrawal. Rates of engagement in end-of-life
      discussions were higher than for documentation of advance care planning for all
      age and most race/ethnicity groups. Although younger participants and minorities 
      were generally less likely to document treatment preferences as compared with
      older patients and Whites, they were not less likely to engage in end-of-life
      discussions. CONCLUSIONS: Preferences for withdrawal vary by race/ ethnicity,
      whereas the pattern of engagement in advance care planning varies by age and
      race/ethnicity. Knowledge of these differences may be useful for improving
      communication about end-of-life preferences and in implementing effective advance
      care planning strategies among diverse haemodialysis patients.

AB  - RATIONALE, AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: Structuring Textual Clinical Guidelines (GLs)
      into a formal representation is a necessary prerequisite for supporting their
      automated application. We had developed a collaborative guideline-structuring
      methodology that involves expert physicians, clinical editors and knowledge
      engineers, to produce a machine-comprehensible representation for automated
      support of evidence-based, guideline-based care. Our goals in the current study
      were: (1) to investigate the perceptions of the expert physicians and clinical
      editors as to the relative importance, for the structuring process, of different 
      aspects of the methodology; (2) to assess, for the clinical editors, the
      inter-correlations among (i) the reported level of understanding of the guideline
      structuring ontology's (knowledge scheme's) features, (ii) the reported ease of
      structuring each feature and (iii) the actual objective quality of structuring.
      METHODS: A clinical consensus regarding the contents of three guidelines was
      prepared by an expert in the domain of each guideline. For each guideline, two
      clinical editors independently structured the guideline into a semi-formal
      representation, using the Asbru guideline ontology's features. The quality of the
      resulting structuring was assessed quantitatively. Each expert physician was
      asked which aspects were most useful for formation of the consensus. Each
      clinical editor filled questionnaires relating to: (1) the level of understanding
      of the ontology's features (before the structuring process); (2) the usefulness
      of various aspects in the structuring process (after the structuring process);
      (3) the ease of structuring each ontological feature (after the structuring
      process). Subjective reports were compared with objective quantitative measures
      of structuring correctness. RESULTS: Expert physicians considered having medical 
      expertise and understanding the ontological features as the aspects most useful
      for creation of a consensus. Clinical editors considered understanding the
      ontological features and the use of the structuring tools as the aspects most
      useful for structuring guidelines. There was a positive correlation (R = 0.87, P 
      < 0.001) between the reported ease of understanding ontological features and the 
      reported ease of structuring those features. However, there was no significant
      correlation between the reported level of understanding the features - or the
      reported ease of structuring by using those features - and the objective quality 
      of the structuring of these features in actual guidelines. CONCLUSIONS: Aspects
      considered important for formation of a clinical consensus differ from those for 
      structuring of guidelines. Understanding the features of a structuring ontology
      is positively correlated with the reported ease of using these features, but
      neither of these subjective reports correlated with the actual objective quality 
      of the structuring using these features.

TI  - Patient education and provider decision support to control blood pressure in
      primary care: a cluster randomized trial.
PG  - 450-6
LID - 10.1016/j.ahj.2008.11.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Less than one third of the 65 million Americans with hypertension
      have adequate blood pressure (BP) control. This study examined the effectiveness 
      of 2 interventions for improving patient BP control. METHODS: This was a 2-level 
      (primary care provider and patient) cluster randomized trial with 2-year
      follow-up occurring among patients with hypertension enrolled from a Veterans
      Affairs Medical Center primary care clinic. Primary care providers (n = 17) in
      the intervention received computer-generated decision support designed to improve
      guideline concordant medical therapy at each visit; control providers (n = 15)
      received a reminder at each visit. Patients received usual care or a bimonthly
      tailored nurse-delivered behavioral telephone intervention to improve
      hypertension treatment. The primary outcome was proportion of patients who
      achieved a BP <140/90 mm Hg (<130/85 for diabetic patients) over the 24-month
      intervention. RESULTS: Of the 816 eligible patients contacted, 190 refused and 38
      were excluded. The 588 enrolled patients had a mean age of 63 years, 43% had
      adequate baseline BP control, and 482 (82%) completed the 24-month follow-up.
      There were no significant differences in amount of change in BP control in the 3 
      intervention groups as compared to the hypertension reminder control group. In
      secondary analyses, rates of BP control for all patients receiving the patient
      behavioral intervention (n = 294) improved from 40.1% to 54.4% at 24 months (P = 
      .03); patients in the nonbehavioral intervention group improved from 38.2% to
      43.9% (P = .38), but there was no between-group differences at the end of the
      study. CONCLUSION: The brief behavioral intervention showed improved outcomes
      over time, but there were not significant between group differences.

PG  - 889-903
LID - 10.1016/j.jbi.2008.04.009 [doi]
AB  - We introduce a three-phase, nine-step methodology for specification of clinical
      guidelines (GLs) by expert physicians, clinical editors, and knowledge engineers 
      and for quantitative evaluation of the specification's quality. We applied this
      methodology to a particular framework for incremental GL structuring (mark-up)
      and to GLs in three clinical domains. A gold-standard mark-up was created,
      including 196 plans and subplans, and 326 instances of ontological knowledge
      roles (KRs). A completeness measure of the acquired knowledge revealed that 97%
      of the plans and 91% of the KR instances of the GLs were recreated by the
      clinical editors. A correctness measure often revealed high variability within
      clinical editor pairs structuring each GL, but for all GLs and clinical editors
      the specification quality was significantly higher than random (p<0.01).
      Procedural KRs were more difficult to mark-up than declarative KRs. We conclude
      that given an ontology-specific consensus, clinical editors with mark-up training
      can structure GL knowledge with high completeness, whereas the main demand for
      correct structuring is training in the ontology's semantics.

TI  - Simple counts of ADL dependencies do not adequately reflect older adults'
      preferences toward states of functional impairment.
PG  - 1261-70
LID - 10.1016/j.jclinepi.2008.05.001 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To use unweighted counts of dependencies in activities of daily living
      (ADLs) to assess the impact of functional impairment requires an assumption of
      equal preferences for each ADL dependency. To test this assumption, we analyzed
      standard gamble (SG) utilities of single and combination ADL dependencies among
      older adults. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: Four hundred older adults used multimedia
      software (FLAIR1) to report SG utilities for their current health and
      hypothetical health states of dependency in each of 7 ADLs and 8 of 30
      combinations of ADL dependencies. RESULTS: Utilities for health states of
      multiple ADL dependencies were often greater than for states of single ADL
      dependencies. Dependence in eating, which is the ADL dependency with the lowest
      utility rating of the single ADL dependencies, ranked lower than 7 combination
      states. Similarly, some combination states with fewer ADL dependencies had lower 
      utilities than those with more ADL dependencies. These findings were consistent
      across groups by gender, age, and education. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that
      the count of ADL dependencies does not adequately represent the utility for a
      health state. Cost-effectiveness analyses and other evaluations of programs that 
      prevent or treat functional dependency should apply utility weights rather than
      relying on simple ADL counts.

TI  - Using health information technology to improve hypertension management.
PG  - 201-7
AB  - High-quality medical care requires implementing evidence-based best practices,
      with continued monitoring to improve performance. Implementation science is
      beginning to identify approaches to developing, implementing, and evaluating
      quality improvement strategies across health care systems that lead to good
      outcomes for patients. Health information technology has much to contribute to
      quality improvement for hypertension, particularly as part of multidimensional
      strategies for improved care. Clinical reminders closely aligned with
      organizational commitment to quality improvement may be one component of a
      successful strategy for improving blood pressure control. The ATHENA-Hypertension
      (Assessment and Treatment of Hypertension: Evidence-based Automation) system is
      an example of more complex clinical decision support. It is feasible to implement
      and deploy innovative health information technologies for clinical decision
      support with features such as clinical data visualizations and evidence to
      support specific recommendations. Further study is needed to determine the
      optimal contexts for such systems and their impact on patient outcomes.

TI  - The impact of chronic hepatitis C and co-morbid illnesses on health-related
      quality of life.
PG  - 715-24
LID - 10.1007/s11136-008-9344-3 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Determine the relative impact of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and
      co-morbid illnesses on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in 3023 randomly
      selected veterans with known hepatitis C virus antibody (anti-HCV) status who
      previously completed a veteran-specific HRQoL questionnaire (SF-36V). METHODS:
      Multiple regression analyses were performed to measure the relative contribution 
      of anti-HCV status, four demographic variables, and ten common medical and six
      psychiatric co-morbidities to HRQoL between 303 anti-HCV(+) and 2720 anti-HCV(-) 
      patients. RESULTS: Anti-HCV(+) veterans were younger, reported a lower HRQoL on
      seven of eight 36-Item Short Form Health Survey for Veterans (SF-36V) subscales
      (P < or = 0.001) and the mental component summary (MCS) scale (P < 0.001). The
      ten medical and six psychiatric co-morbidities had variable impact on predicting 
      lower HRQoL in both groups. After adjusting for demographic variables and
      co-morbid illnesses, we found that anti-HCV(+) patients reported a significantly 
      lower MCS score (P < 0.001) and a trend toward a lower physical component summary
      (PCS) score (P < 0.07) compared to anti-HCV(-) veterans. Among the anti-HCV(+)
      veterans, co-morbid medical illnesses contributed to impaired PCS but not to MCS.
      CONCLUSIONS: Veterans with CHC were younger than HCV(-) veterans and hence less
      likely to have other co-morbid medical illnesses. Medical co-morbidities seen in 
      those veterans with CHC contribute to impaired PCS but not MCS. Anti-HCV(+)
      status negatively affects HRQoL, particularly MCS, independently of medical and
      psychiatric co-morbidities.

TI  - Evaluation of an architecture for intelligent query and exploration of
      time-oriented clinical data.
PG  - 17-34
LID - 10.1016/j.artmed.2008.03.006 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Evaluate KNAVE-II, a knowledge-based framework for visualization,
      interpretation, and exploration of longitudinal clinical data, clinical concepts 
      and patterns. KNAVE-II mediates queries to a distributed temporal-abstraction
      architecture (IDAN), which uses a knowledge-based problem-solving method
      specializing in on-the-fly computation of clinical queries. METHODS: A two-phase,
      balanced cross-over study to compare efficiency and satisfaction of a group of
      clinicians when answering queries of variable complexity about time-oriented
      clinical data, typical for oncology protocols, using KNAVE-II, versus standard
      methods: both paper charts and a popular electronic spreadsheet (ESS) in Phase I;
      an ESS in Phase II. The measurements included the time required to answer and the
      correctness of answer for each query and each complexity category, and for all
      queries, assessed versus a predetermined gold standard set by a domain expert.
      User satisfaction was assessed by the Standard Usability Score (SUS)
      tool-specific questionnaire and by a "Usability of Tool Comparison" comparative
      questionnaire developed for this study. RESULTS: In both evaluations, subjects
      answered higher-complexity queries significantly faster using KNAVE-II than when 
      using paper charts or an ESS up to a mean of 255 s difference per query versus
      the ESS for hard queries (p=0.0003) in the second evaluation. Average correctness
      scores when using KNAVE-II versus paper charts, in the first phase, and the ESS, 
      in the second phase, were significantly higher over all queries. In the second
      evaluation, 91.6% (110/120) of all of the questions asked within queries of all
      levels produced correct answers using KNAVE-II, opposed to only 57.5% (69/120)
      using the ESS (p<0.0001). User satisfaction with KNAVE-II was significantly
      superior compared to using either a paper chart or the ESS (p=0.006). Clinicians 
      ranked KNAVE-II superior to both paper and the ESS. CONCLUSIONS: An evaluation of
      the functionality and usability of KNAVE-II and its supporting knowledge-based
      temporal-mediation architecture has produced highly encouraging results regarding
      saving of physician time, enhancement of accuracy of clinical assessment, and
      user satisfaction.

TI  - Implementing effective hypertension quality improvement strategies: barriers and 
      potential solutions.
PG  - 311-6
AB  - Many quality improvement strategies have focused on improving blood pressure
      control, and these strategies can target the patient, the provider, and/or the
      system. Strategies that seem to have the biggest effect on blood pressure
      outcomes are team change, patient education, facilitated relay of clinical
      information, and promotion of self-management. Barriers to effective blood
      pressure control can affect the patient, the physician, the system, and/or "cues 
      to action."We review the barriers to achieving blood pressure control and
      describe current and potential creative strategies for optimizing blood pressure 
      control. These include home-based disease management, combined patient and
      provider education, and automatic decision support systems. Future research must 
      address which components of quality improvement interventions are most successful
      in achieving blood pressure control.

TI  - Information technology to support improved care for chronic illness.
PG  - 425-30
AB  - BACKGROUND: In populations with chronic illness, outcomes improve with the use of
      care models that integrate clinical information, evidence-based treatments, and
      proactive management of care. Health information technology is believed to be
      critical for efficient implementation of these chronic care models. Health care
      organizations have implemented information technologies, such as electronic
      medical records, to varying degrees. However, considerable uncertainty remains
      regarding the relative impact of specific informatics technologies on chronic
      illness care. OBJECTIVE: To summarize knowledge and increase expert consensus
      regarding informatics components that support improvement in chronic illness
      care. DESIGN: A systematic review of the literature was performed. "Use case"
      models were then developed, based on the literature review, and guidance from
      clinicians and national quality improvement projects. A national expert panel
      process was conducted to increase consensus regarding information system
      components that can be used to improve chronic illness care. RESULTS: The expert 
      panel agreed that informatics should be patient-centered, focused on improving
      outcomes, and provide support for illness self-management. They concurred that
      outcomes should be routinely assessed, provided to clinicians during the clinical
      encounter, and used for population-based care management. It was recommended that
      interactive, sequential, disorder-specific treatment pathways be implemented to
      quickly provide clinicians with patient clinical status, treatment history, and
      decision support. CONCLUSIONS: Specific informatics strategies have the potential
      to improve care for chronic illness. Software to implement these strategies
      should be developed, and rigorously evaluated within the context of
      organizational efforts to improve care.

TI  - Runtime application of Hybrid-Asbru clinical guidelines.
PG  - 507-26
AB  - Clinical guidelines are a major tool in improving the quality of medical care.
      However, to support the automation of guideline-based care, several requirements 
      must be filled, such as specification of the guidelines in a
      machine-interpretable format and a connection to an Electronic Patient Record
      (EPR). For several different reasons, it is beneficial to convert free-text
      guidelines gradually, through several intermediate representations, to a
      machine-interpretable format. It is also realistic to consider the case when an
      EPR is unavailable. We propose an innovative approach to the runtime application 
      of intermediate-represented Hybrid-Asbru guidelines, with or without an available
      EPR. The new approach capitalizes on our extensive work on developing the Digital
      electronic Guideline Library (DeGeL) framework. The new approach was implemented 
      as the Spock system. For evaluation, three guidelines were specified in an
      intermediate format and were applied to a set of simulated patient records
      designed to cover prototypical cases. In all cases, the Spock system produced the
      expected output, and did not produce an unexpected one. Thus, we have
      demonstrated the capability of the Spock system to apply guidelines encoded in
      the Hybrid-Asbru intermediate representation, when an EPR is not available.

TI  - Association of antihypertensive therapy and diastolic hypotension in chronic
      kidney disease.
PG  - 474-80
AB  - The extent to which chronic kidney disease (CKD) affects achievement of blood
      pressure targets is not comprehensively understood. We evaluated the effects of
      CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate: <60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) on
      achievement of blood pressure control (nondiabetic: <140/90 mm Hg; diabetic:
      <130/85 mm Hg) using data from the Guidelines for Drug Therapy of Hypertension
      Trial. This 15-month study obtained outpatient blood pressures from 3 Veteran's
      Affairs institutions. Among 9985 subjects with hypertension, we evaluated the
      association of CKD with achieved control and antihypertensive medication use. We 
      also explored the association between the number of antihypertensives and
      systolic, diastolic, and pulse pressure. After 15 months, 41% of participants met
      blood pressure targets. CKD was not associated with control (adjusted odds ratio:
      1.04; 95% CI: 0.93 to 1.15). However, CKD was associated with higher odds of use 
      of >or=3 medications among nondiabetic subjects (odds ratio: 1.46; 95% CI: 1.25
      to 1.71) and diabetic subjects (odds ratio: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.17 to 1.66). A
      significant interaction was observed between CKD and the number of
      antihypertensives as determinants of diastolic and pulse pressures. Among non-CKD
      participants, a greater number of antihypertensives (0 compared with 4) was
      associated with wider pulse pressure (Delta5.2 mm Hg; P<0.001), mainly because of
      higher systolic pressures (Delta3.6 mm Hg; P=0.001). Among participants with CKD,
      although greater numbers of antihypertensives were associated with even wider
      pulse pressures (Delta8.3 mm Hg; P<0.001), this was primarily because of lower
      diastolic pressures (Delta4.8 mm Hg; P<0.01). Among participants with CKD,
      greater use of antihypertensives was associated with lower diastolic pressures.
      Given recent evidence suggesting adverse effects of diastolic hypotension, these 
      results suggest potential risks in patients with CKD from aggressive attempts to 
      control systolic blood pressure.

TI  - Clinical reminders attached to echocardiography reports of patients with reduced 
      left ventricular ejection fraction increase use of beta-blockers: a randomized
      trial.
PG  - 2829-34
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although beta-blockers are known to prolong survival for patients
      with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction, they are often underused. We
      hypothesized that a reminder attached to the echocardiography report would
      increase the use of beta-blockers for patients with reduced left ventricular
      ejection fraction. METHODS AND RESULTS: We randomized 1546 consecutive patients
      with a left ventricular ejection fraction <45% found on echocardiography at 1 of 
      3 laboratories to a reminder for use of beta-blockers or no reminder. Patients
      were excluded from analysis if they died within 30 days of randomization (n=89), 
      did not receive medications through the Veterans Affairs system after 30 days
      (n=180), or underwent echocardiography at >1 laboratory (n=6). The primary
      outcome was a prescription for an oral beta-blocker between 1 and 9 months after 
      randomization. The mean age of the 1271 included patients was 69 years; 60% had a
      history of heart failure, and 51% were receiving treatment with beta-blockers at 
      the time of echocardiography. More patients randomized to the reminder had a
      subsequent beta-blocker prescription (74%, 458 of 621) compared with those
      randomized to no reminder (66%, 428 of 650; P=0.002). The effect of the reminder 
      was not significantly different for subgroups based on patient location
      (inpatient versus outpatient) or prior use of beta-blockers. CONCLUSIONS: A
      reminder attached to the echocardiography report increased the use of
      beta-blockers in patients with depressed left ventricular systolic function.

TI  - Hypertension Intervention Nurse Telemedicine Study (HINTS): testing a
      multifactorial tailored behavioral/educational and a medication management
      intervention for blood pressure control.
PG  - 918-24
AB  - BACKGROUND: Only 31% of Americans with hypertension have their blood pressure
      (BP) under effective control. We describe a study that tests 3 different
      interventions in a randomized controlled trial using home BP telemedicine
      monitoring. METHODS: A sample of hypertensive patients with poor BP control at
      baseline (N = 600) are randomized to 1 of 4 arms: (1) control group--a group of
      hypertensive patients who receive usual care; (2) nurse-administered tailored
      behavioral intervention; (3) nurse-administered medication management according
      to a hypertension decision support system; (4) combination of the 2
      interventions. The interventions are triggered based on home BP values
      transmitted via telemonitoring devices over standard telephone lines. The
      tailored behavioral intervention involves promoting adherence with medication and
      health behaviors. Patients randomized to the medication management or the
      combined arm have their hypertension regimen changed by the study team using a
      validated hypertension decision support system based on evidence-based
      hypertension treatment guidelines and individualized to patients' comorbid
      illnesses. The primary outcome is BP control: < or = 140/90 mm Hg (nondiabetic)
      and < or = 130/80 mm Hg (diabetics) measured at 6-month intervals over 18 months 
      (4 total measurements). CONCLUSIONS: Given the increasing prevalence of
      hypertension and our inability to achieve adequate BP control using traditional
      models of care, testing novel interventions in patients' homes may improve
      access, quality, and outcomes.

TI  - Does cancer risk affect health-related quality of life in patients with Barrett's
      esophagus?
PG  - 16-25
AB  - BACKGROUND: Health-related quality of life is decreased in patients with GERD and
      Barrett's esophagus (BE). OBJECTIVE: To determine whether time-tradeoff (TTO)
      values would differ in patients with BE when patients were asked to trade away
      the potential risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma rather than chronic heartburn
      symptoms. DESIGN: A prospective clinical trial. PATIENTS: Subjects with
      biopsy-proven BE. INTERVENTIONS: Custom-designed computer program to elicit
      health-state utility values, quality of life in reflux and dyspepsia (QOLRAD),
      and Medical Outcomes Survey short form-36 surveys. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: TTO
      utility values for the annual cancer-risk-associated current health state and for
      hypothetical scenarios of dysplasia and esophageal cancer. RESULTS: We studied 60
      patients in the cancer-risk cohort (57 men, 92% veteran; mean age [standard
      deviation; SD], 65 years [11 years], mean GERD duration 17 years [12 years]). The
      heartburn cohort included 40 patients with GERD and BE with TTO values derived
      for GERD symptoms. The mean (SD) utility for nondysplastic BE was 0.91 (0.13)
      compared with 0.90 (0.12) for the heartburn cohort (P = .7). The mean utility
      values were significantly lower for scenarios of low-grade dysplasia (0.85
      [0.12], P = .02) and high-grade dysplasia (0.77 [0.14], P < .005). The mean TTO
      was 0.67 (0.19) for the scenario of esophageal cancer. There was no correlation
      between the utility scores and the disease-specific survey scores. LIMITATIONS:
      TTO values were hypothetical for states of dysplasia and cancer. CONCLUSIONS: TTO
      utility values based on heartburn symptoms or annual risk of cancer in patients
      with nondysplastic BE are roughly equivalent. However, TTO utility values are
      significantly lower for health states with increasing cancer risks.

TI  - The impact of chronic hepatitis C and comorbid psychiatric illnesses on
      health-related quality of life.
PG  - 528-34
AB  - GOALS: To determine the relative impact of chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and comorbid
      psychiatric illness on the health-related quality of life (HRQoL). BACKGROUND:
      Psychiatric conditions are more common among patients with CHC but their relative
      influence on HRQoL is not well understood. STUDY: We identified 864 veterans who 
      had previously completed a veteran-specific HRQoL questionnaire (SF-36V) as part 
      of the 1999 VA Large Health Survey with known HCV antibody (anti-HCV) status
      before the survey. For 201 anti-HCV(+) and 663 anti-HCV(-) patients, we compared 
      the HRQoL status and the prevalence of 6 major psychiatric diagnoses. We
      conducted multiple regression analyses to measure the effect of anti-HCV status
      and psychiatric comorbidity. RESULTS: Compared with the anti-HCV(-) group,
      anti-HCV(+) veterans were more likely to have alcohol dependence (P<0.001),
      depression (P=0.01), or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) (P<0.004). The
      anti-HCV(+) group also reported lower HRQoL on 4 of the 8 SF-36V subscales
      (P<0.01) and the mental component summary scale (P<0.001). Even after adjusting
      for demographic variables and comorbid psychiatric illness, anti-HCV(+) patients 
      reported a significantly lower mental component summary score (P<0.01) than did
      anti-HCV(-) patients. Multiple regression analysis found that depression and PTSD
      predicted lower HRQoL scores for all 8 HRQoL subscales (P<0.01) and both the
      physical (P<0.001) and mental component (P<0.03) summary scales independent of
      anti-HCV status. CONCLUSIONS: The HRQoL is significantly impaired in veterans
      with CHC, particularly the mental health components of HRQoL. In contrast,
      comorbid depression and PTSD are associated with both lower physical and mental
      components of HRQol, independent of CHC.

TI  - Quality improvement strategies for hypertension management: a systematic review.
PG  - 646-57
AB  - BACKGROUND: Care remains suboptimal for many patients with hypertension. PURPOSE:
      The purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness of quality improvement 
      (QI) strategies in lowering blood pressure. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Cochrane
      databases, and article bibliographies were searched for this study. STUDY
      SELECTION: Trials, controlled before-after studies, and interrupted time series
      evaluating QI interventions targeting hypertension control and reporting blood
      pressure outcomes were studied. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers abstracted data
      and classified QI strategies into categories: provider education, provider
      reminders, facilitated relay of clinical information, patient education,
      self-management, patient reminders, audit and feedback, team change, or financial
      incentives were extracted. DATA SYNTHESIS: Forty-four articles reporting 57
      comparisons underwent quantitative analysis. Patients in the intervention groups 
      experienced median reductions in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic
      blood pressure (DBP) that were 4.5 mm Hg (interquartile range [IQR]: 1.5 to 11.0)
      and 2.1 mm Hg (IQR: -0.2 to 5.0) greater than observed for control patients.
      Median increases in the percentage of individuals achieving target goals for SBP 
      and DBP were 16.2% (IQR: 10.3 to 32.2) and 6.0% (IQR: 1.5 to 17.5). Interventions
      that included team change as a QI strategy were associated with the largest
      reductions in blood pressure outcomes. All team change studies included
      assignment of some responsibilities to a health professional other than the
      patient's physician. LIMITATIONS: Not all QI strategies have been assessed
      equally, which limits the power to compare differences in effects between
      strategies. CONCLUSION: QI strategies are associated with improved hypertension
      control. A focus on hypertension by someone in addition to the patient's
      physician was associated with substantial improvement. Future research should
      examine the contributions of individual QI strategies and their relative costs.

TI  - Use of declarative statements in creating and maintaining computer-interpretable 
      knowledge bases for guideline-based care.
PG  - 784-8
AB  - Developing computer-interpretable clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to provide 
      decision support for guideline-based care is an extremely labor-intensive task.
      In the EON/ATHENA and SAGE projects, we formulated substantial portions of CPGs
      as computable statements that express declarative relationships between patient
      conditions and possible interventions. We developed query and expression
      languages that allow a decision-support system (DSS) to evaluate these statements
      in specific patient situations. A DSS can use these guideline statements in
      multiple ways, including: (1) as inputs for determining preferred alternatives in
      decision-making, and (2) as a way to provide targeted commentaries in the
      clinical information system. The use of these declarative statements
      significantly reduces the modeling expertise and effort required to create and
      maintain computer-interpretable knowledge bases for decision-support purpose. We 
      discuss possible implications for sharing of such knowledge bases.

TI  - Offline testing of the ATHENA Hypertension decision support system knowledge base
      to improve the accuracy of recommendations.
PG  - 539-43
AB  - ATHENA-HTN is a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that delivers
      guideline-based patient-specific recommendations about hypertension management at
      the time of clinical decision-making. The ATHENA-HTN knowledge is stored in a
      knowledge-base (KB). Changes in best-practice recommendations require updates to 
      the KB. We describe a method of offline testing to evaluate the accuracy of
      recommendations generated from the KB. A physician reviewed 100 test cases and
      made drug recommendations based on guidelines and the "Rules" (descriptions of
      encoded knowledge). These drug recommendations were compared to those generated
      by ATHENA-HTN. Nineteen drug-recommendation discrepancies were identified:
      ATHENA-HTN was more complete in generating recommendations (15); ambiguities in
      the Rules misled the physician (3); and content in the Rules was not encoded (1).
      Three new boundaries were identified. Three updates were made to the KB based on 
      the results. The offline testing method was successful in identifying areas for
      KB improvement and led to improved accuracy of guideline-based recommendations.

TI  - Identifying barriers to hypertension guideline adherence using clinician feedback
      at the point of care.
PG  - 494-8
AB  - Factors contributing to low adherence to clinical guidelines by clinicians are
      not well understood. The user interface of ATHENA-HTN, a guideline-based decision
      support system (DSS) for hypertension, presents a novel opportunity to collect
      clinician feedback on recommendations displayed at the point of care. We analyzed
      feedback from 46 clinicians who received ATHENA advisories as part of a 15-month 
      randomized trial to identify potential reasons clinicians may not intensify
      hypertension therapy when it is recommended. Among the 368 visits for which
      feedback was provided, clinicians commonly reported they did not follow
      recommendations because: recorded blood pressure was not representative of the
      patient's typical blood pressure; hypertension was not a clinical priority for
      the visit; or patients were nonadherent to medications. For many visits, current 
      quality-assurance algorithms may incorrectly identify clinically appropriate
      decisions as guideline nonadherent due to incomplete capture of relevant
      information. We present recommendations for how automated DSSs may help identify 
      "apparent" barriers and better target decision support.

TI  - Task analysis of writing hospital admission orders: evidence of a problem-based
      approach.
PG  - 389-93
AB  - As part of a broader project to improve the usability of computerized physician
      order entry (CPOE)systems, we set out to study the cognitive tasks physicians
      undertake to write "admission orders" when admitting a patient to the hospital.
      In particular, we evaluate the hypothesis that physicians' mental model of
      diagnostic and therapeutic planning is problem based, whereas both paper-based
      ordering and CPOE are typically organized around functional categories of orders 
      such as those reflected in the mnemonic ADCVAANDIML. A task analysis was
      performed which included think-aloud observations of physicians writing orders in
      clinical care settings and for fictional case-scenarios, as well as a
      semistructured questionnaire. Our work finds core tasks of admitting a patient to
      hospital and conflicts between physicians' mental model and traditional ordering 
      systems. Based on our study, we suggest improvements to traditional CPOE systems.

TI  - Knowledge-based method for building patient decision-analytic tools.
PG  - 175-9
AB  - Numerous health decision aids (HDAs) have been developed to increase the
      participation of patients in shared decision-making, but many have limited
      accessibility and narrow applicability in clinical care. In the Health e-Decision
      project, we address these limitations in our work on building general HDAs
      targeted for older adults. Our approach uses a decision-support software
      architecture that enables principled methods for HDAs. We have formalized a novel
      knowledge-based decision model (KBDM), using Protege OWL, that developers and
      clinicians can instantiate to tailor the components of the architecture for a
      particular health problem. In this paper, we present the methods used in the
      architecture and the knowledgebase design; the latter encompasses
      influence-diagram concepts, specific health problems, health outcome states, and 
      probabilistic relationships. We discuss how this approach improves upon prior HDA
      methods. We also show that our use of computer-interpretable knowledge provides a
      structured, customizable means of enabling patient-centered decision support.

TI  - Racial differences in blood pressure control: potential explanatory factors.
PG  - 70.e9-15
AB  - PURPOSE: Poor blood pressure control remains a common problem that contributes to
      significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, particularly among African
      Americans. We explored antihypertensive medication adherence and other factors
      that may explain racial differences in blood pressure control. METHODS: Baseline 
      data were obtained from the Veteran's Study to Improve The Control of
      Hypertension, a randomized controlled trial designed to improve blood pressure
      control. Clinical, demographic, and psychosocial factors relating to blood
      pressure control were examined. RESULTS: A total of 569 patients who were African
      American (41%) or white (59%) were enrolled in the study. African Americans were 
      more likely to have inadequate baseline blood pressure control than whites (63%
      vs 50%; odds ratio = 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-2.41). Among 20
      factors related to blood pressure control, African Americans also had a higher
      odds ratio of being nonadherent to their medication, being more functionally
      illiterate, and having a family member with hypertension compared with whites.
      Compared with whites, African Americans also were more likely to perceive high
      blood pressure as serious and to experience the side effect of increased
      urination compared with whites. Adjusting for these differences reduced the odds 
      ratio of African Americans having adequate blood pressure control to 1.59 (95%
      confidence interval 1.09-2.29). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of hypertensive
      patients who have good access to health care and medication benefits, African
      Americans continued to have lower levels of blood pressure control despite
      considering more than 20 factors related to blood pressure control. Interventions
      designed to improve medication adherence need to take race into account.
      Patients' self-reports of failure to take medications provide an opportunity for 
      clinicians to explore reasons for medication nonadherence, thereby improving
      adherence and potentially blood pressure control.

TI  - The effect of geriatrics evaluation and management on nursing home use and health
      care costs: results from a randomized trial.
PG  - 91-5
AB  - BACKGROUND: The Geriatric Evaluation and Management study was developed to assess
      the impact of a comprehensive geriatric assessment service on the care of the
      elderly. OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate the cost and clinical impact of
      inpatient units and outpatient clinics for geriatric evaluation and management.
      RESEARCH DESIGN: We undertook a prospective, randomized, controlled trial using a
      2x2 factorial design, with 1-year follow-up. SUBJECTS: A total of 1388
      participants hospitalized on either a medical or surgical ward at 11
      participating Veterans Affairs medical centers were randomized to receive either 
      inpatient geriatric unit (GEMU) or usual inpatient care (UCIP), followed by
      either outpatient care from a geriatric clinic (GEMC) versus usual outpatient
      care (UCOP). MEASURES: We measured health care utilization and costs. RESULTS:
      Patients assigned to the GEMU had a significantly decreased rate of nursing home 
      placement (odds ratio=0.65; P=0.001). Neither the GEMU nor GEMC had any
      statistically significant improvement effects on survival and only modest effects
      on health status. There were statistically insignificant mean cost savings of
      $1027 (P=0.29) per patient for the GEMU and $1665 (P=0.69) per patient for the
      GEMC. CONCLUSIONS: Inpatient or outpatient geriatric evaluation and management
      units didn't increase the costs of care. Although there was no effect on survival
      and only modest effects on SF-36 scores at 1-year follow-up, there was a
      statistically significant reduction in nursing home admissions for patients
      treated in the GEMU.

TI  - Improving adherence to guidelines for hypertension drug prescribing:
      cluster-randomized controlled trial of general versus patient-specific
      recommendations.
PG  - 677-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention focusing clinician attention on
      drug choice for hypertension treatment improves concordance between drug regimens
      and guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: Cluster-randomized controlled trial comparing an
      individualized intervention with a general guideline implementation in
      geographically diverse primary care clinics of a university-affiliated Department
      of Veterans Affairs healthcare system. METHODS: Participants were 36 attending
      physicians and nurse practitioners (16 in the general group and 20 in the
      individualized group), with findings based on 4500 hypertensive patients. A
      general guideline implementation for all clinicians, including education about
      guideline-based drug recommendations and goals for adequacy of blood pressure
      control, was compared with addition of a printed individualized advisory sent to 
      clinicians at each patient visit, indicating whether or not the patient's
      antihypertensive drug regimen was guideline concordant. We measured change from
      baseline to end point in the proportion of clinicians' patients whose drug
      therapy was guideline concordant. RESULTS: The individualized intervention
      resulted in an improvement in guideline concordance more than twice that observed
      for the general intervention (10.9% vs 3.8%, t = 2.796, P = .008). Bootstrap
      analysis showed that being in the individualized group increased the odds of
      concordance 1.5-fold (P = .025). The proportion of patients with adequate blood
      pressure control increased within each study group; however, the difference
      between groups was not significant. CONCLUSION: An individualized advisory
      regarding drug therapy for hypertension given to the clinician at each patient
      visit was more effective in changing clinician prescribing behavior than
      implementation of a general guideline.

TI  - The veterans' study to improve the control of hypertension (V-STITCH): design and
      methodology.
PG  - 155-68
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the 60 million Americans with hypertension, only approximately 
      31% have their blood pressure (BP) under control (<140/90 mm Hg). Despite the
      damaging impact of hypertension and the availability of evidence-based target
      values for BP, interventions to improve BP control have had limited success.
      OBJECTIVES: A randomized controlled health services intervention trial with a
      split-plot design is being conducted to improve BP control. This 4-year trial
      evaluates both a patient and a provider intervention in a primary care setting
      among diagnosed hypertensive veterans. METHODS: In a cluster-randomization, 30
      primary care providers in the Durham VAMC Primary Care Clinic were randomly
      assigned to receive the provider intervention or control. The provider
      intervention is a patient-specific electronically generated hypertension decision
      support system (DSS) delivering guideline-based recommendations to the provider
      at each patient's visit, designed to improve guideline-concordant therapy. For
      these providers, a sample of their hypertensive patients (n=588) was randomly
      assigned to receive a telephone-administered patient intervention or usual care. 
      The patient intervention incorporates patients' need assessments and involves
      tailored behavioral and education modules to promote medication adherence and
      improve specific health behaviors. All modules are delivered over the telephone
      bi-monthly for 24 months. In this trial, the primary outcome is the proportion of
      patients who achieve a BP < or =140/90 mm Hg at each outpatient clinic visit over
      24 months. CONCLUSION: Despite the known risk of poor BP control, a majority of
      adults still do not have their BP controlled. This study is an important step in 
      testing the effectiveness of a patient and provider intervention to improve BP
      control among veterans in the primary care setting.

TI  - Invariance and inconsistency in utility ratings.
PG  - 158-67
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess utilities of composite health states for dependence in
      activities of daily living (ADLs) for invariance (i.e., when subjects provide a
      utility of 1 for all health states) and order inconsistency (i.e., when subjects 
      order their utilities such that their utility for a combination of ADL
      dependencies is greater than their utility for any subset of the combination).
      METHODS: Each of the 400 subjects, age 65 y and older, enrolled in one of several
      regional medical centers of the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program of
      Northern California and provided standard-gamble utilities for single ADL
      dependencies (e.g., bathing, dressing, continence) and for dependence in 8 other 
      combinations of ADL dependencies. For order-inconsistent responses, the authors
      calculated the maximum magnitude of inconsistency as the maximum difference
      between the utility for the combined ADL dependence health state and that of its 
      inconsistent subset. RESULTS: A total of 76 subjects (19%) gave a utility of 1.0 
      for all health states presented to them; 19 (5%) gave the same utility other than
      1.0 for all health states; 130 (33%) gave at least 1 utility < 1.0 and had no
      order inconsistencies; and 175 (44%) had at least 1 order inconsistency.
      Invariance was associated with a Mini-Mental Status Examination score < 28.6 (P =
      0.01), with education < 12 y (P = 0.004), with race/ethnicity other than
      non-Hispanic White/Caucasian (P = 0.001), and with shorter time spent on the
      utility elicitation task (P < 0.0001). Among the inconsistent subjects, 69% had a
      maximal magnitude of inconsistency that was within 1 standard deviation of the
      mean utilities. The maximal magnitude of inconsistency was associated with longer
      time spent on the elicitation task (P < 0.0001) and race/ethnicity other than
      non-Hispanic White/Caucasian (P = 0.005). The mean (s) utility for dependence in 
      continence among consistent subjects who were not invariant (0.88 [0.24]) was
      higher than among inconsistent subjects (0.80 [0.27]; P = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS:
      Invariance and order inconsistencies in utility ratings for complex health states
      occur frequently. Utilities of consistent subjects may differ from those of
      inconsistent subjects. Utility assessments should attempt to measure and report
      these patterns.

PG  - 915
AB  - Studies of barriers to guideline adherence have generally surveyed clinicians
      temporally remote from the clinical scenario in which recommendations were
      delivered, potentially adversely biasing clinician observations. The user
      interface of ATHENA DSS, a guideline-based decision support system for
      hypertension, includes a point-of-care feedback window that accepts
      clinician-user comments during the display of recommendations. Analysis of this
      feedback has revealed a number of intriguing patient, provider, and technical
      barriers to adherence collected during real-time system use.

TI  - Multimedia quality of life assessment: advances with FLAIR.
PG  - 694-8
AB  - Assessing impact of functional dependency on quality of life (QOL) among older
      adults can provide an in-depth understanding of health preferences. Utilities as 
      a measure of preferences are necessary in conducting cost-effectiveness
      evaluations of healthcare interventions designed to improve overall QOL. We
      describe further development of a multimedia utility elicitation instrument that 
      is highly portable and easily accessible. An earlier version, FLAIR1, introduced 
      features designed for older adult, computer inexperienced users. FLAIR2 includes 
      modifications such as migration to a web-based platform, consistency checks,
      audio/visual updates, and more response methods. As compared with FLAIR1, more
      FLAIR2 respondents (n=318) preferred using the computer and found the computer
      program to be enjoyable, easy to use, and easily understood. There were also
      fewer inconsistencies among FLAIR2 respondents. FLAIR2 enhancements have
      increased portability, minimized invariance and inconsistency, and produced a
      more user friendly design.

TI  - Behavioral interventions and cost-effectiveness analysis.
PG  - 1208-14
AB  - Behavioral health interventions are often gauged with a dichotomous outcome,
      "success" or "failure." Hidden by this dichotomy is a series of behavior changes 
      that can be followed with the Transtheoretical Model (stages of change). There
      has been little consideration, however, about whether this information can and
      should be used in cost-effectiveness analysis. We review the stages of change
      model and its applications to behavioral health interventions. We then discuss
      analytical methods for including stages of change, or similar behavior change
      models, in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). This is typically not done but it
      may be critical for study design and for interpreting CEA results.

TI  - Clinician awareness of adherence to hypertension guidelines.
PG  - 747-54
AB  - PURPOSE: Little is known about how well clinicians are aware of their own
      adherence to clinical guidelines, an important indicator of quality. We compared 
      clinicians' beliefs about their adherence to hypertension guidelines with data on
      their actual performance. METHODS: We surveyed 139 primary care clinicians at
      three Veterans Affairs medical centers, asking them to assess their own adherence
      to hypertension guidelines. We then extracted data from the centers' clinical
      databases on guideline-concordant medication use and blood pressure control for
      patients cared for by these providers during a 6-month period. Data were
      collected for patients with hypertension and diabetes, hypertension and coronary 
      disease, or hypertension with neither of these comorbid conditions. RESULTS:
      Eighty-six clinicians (62%) completed the survey. Each clinician saw a median of 
      94 patients with hypertension (mean age, 65 years). Patients were treated with an
      average of 1.6 antihypertensive medications. Overall, clinicians overestimated
      the proportion of their patients who were prescribed guideline-concordant
      medications (75% perceived vs. 67% actual, P <0.001) and who had blood pressure
      levels <140/90 mm Hg on their last visit (68% perceived vs. 43% actual, P
      <0.001). Among individual clinicians, there were no significant correlations
      between perceived and actual guideline adherence (r = 0.18 for medications, r =
      0.14 for blood pressure control; P > or =0.10 for both). Clinicians with
      relatively low actual guideline performance were most likely to overestimate
      their adherence to medication recommendations and blood pressure targets.
      CONCLUSION: Clinicians appear to overestimate their adherence to hypertension
      guidelines, particularly with regards to the proportion of their patients with
      controlled blood pressure. This limited awareness may represent a barrier to
      successful implementation of guidelines, and could be addressed through the use
      of provider profiles and point-of-service feedback to clinicians.

TI  - Health-related quality of life in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension.
PG  - 1452-9
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) often
      present with dyspnea and severe functional limitations, but their health-related 
      quality of life (HRQOL) has not been studied extensively. This study describes
      HRQOL in a cohort of patients with PAH. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: A
      tertiary care, university hospital-based, pulmonary hypertension (PH) clinic.
      PARTICIPANTS: We studied HRQOL in 53 patients with PAH (mean age, 47 years;
      median duration of disease, 559 days). Eighty-three percent were women, 53%
      received epoprostenol, and 72% reported moderate-to-severe functional limitations
      with a New York Heart Association class 3 or 4 at enrollment. MEASUREMENTS AND
      RESULTS: We examined HRQOL by administering the Nottingham Health Profile,
      Congestive Heart Failure Questionnaire, and Hospital Anxiety and Depression
      Scale. We used the Visual Analog Scale and standard gamble (SG) techniques to
      measure preferences for current health (utilities). Compared with population
      norms, participants reported moderate-to-severe impairment in multiple domains of
      HRQOL, including physical mobility, emotional reaction, pain, energy, sleep, and 
      social isolation. Mean SG utilities were 0.71, suggesting that, on average,
      participants were willing to accept a 29% risk of death in order to be cured of
      PH. CONCLUSIONS: PAH is a devastating condition that affects predominately young 
      women in the prime of their life. Understanding HRQOL and preferences are
      important in the care and management of these patients. Compared with population 
      norms, patients with PAH have substantial functional and emotional limitations
      that adversely affect their HRQOL.

      guideline knowledge with electronic patient data to present real-time,
      patient-specific recommendations. However, technical success in implementing
      decision support systems may not translate directly into system use by
      clinicians. Successful technology integration into clinical work settings
      requires explicit attention to the organizational context. We describe the
      application of a "sociotechnical" approach to integration of ATHENA DSS, a
      decision support system for the treatment of hypertension, into geographically
      dispersed primary care clinics. We applied an iterative technical design in
      response to organizational input and obtained ongoing endorsements of the project
      by the organization's administrative and clinical leadership. Conscious attention
      to organizational context at the time of development, deployment, and maintenance
      of the system was associated with extensive clinician use of the system.

TI  - A catalog of dermatology utilities: a measure of the burden of skin diseases.
PG  - 160-8
AB  - Utilities are measures of quality of life that reflect the strength of
      individuals' preferences or values for a particular health outcome. As such,
      utilities represent a measure of disease burden. The aim of this article is to
      introduce the concept of utilities to the dermatology community and to present a 
      catalog of dermatology utilities obtained from direct patient interviews. Our
      data are based on 236 total subjects from Grady Hospital (Atlanta, GA), Stanford 
      Medical Center (Palo Alto, CA), and Parkland Hospital (Dallas, TX). The mean time
      trade-off utilities ranged from 0.640 for blistering disorders to 1.000 for
      alopecia, cosmetic, and urticaria. The mean utility across all diagnoses was
      0.943. We present utilities for 17 diagnostic categories and discuss the
      underlying reasons for the significant disease burden that these utilities
      represent. We also present these dermatology categories relative to noncutaneous 
      diseases to place the cutaneous utilities in perspective and to compare the
      burden of disease. We have demonstrated that skin diseases have considerable
      burden of disease and provided a preliminary repository of utility data for
      future researchers and policy makers.

TI  - An intelligent case-adjustment algorithm for the automated design of
      population-based quality auditing protocols.
PG  - 1003-7
AB  - We develop a method and algorithm for deciding the optimal approach to creating
      quality-auditing protocols for guideline-based clinical performance measures. An 
      important element of the audit protocol design problem is deciding which
      guide-line elements to audit. Specifically, the problem is how and when to
      aggregate individual patient case-specific guideline elements into
      population-based quality measures. The key statistical issue involved is the
      trade-off between increased reliability with more general population-based
      quality measures versus increased validity from individually case-adjusted but
      more restricted measures done at a greater audit cost. Our intelligent algorithm 
      for auditing protocol design is based on hierarchically modeling incrementally
      case-adjusted quality constraints. We select quality constraints to measure using
      an optimization criterion based on statistical generalizability coefficients. We 
      present results of the approach from a deployed decision support system for a
      hypertension guideline.

TI  - Evaluation of KNAVE-II: a tool for intelligent query and exploration of patient
      data.
PG  - 648-52
AB  - We present the results of a preliminary evaluation of KNAVE-II, a distributed
      knowledge-based computational framework for visualization, interpretation, and
      exploration of longitudinal clinical data and of multiple levels of concepts
      derivable from these data. KNAVE-II uses a distributed architecture to access at 
      run-time clinical time-oriented data, a domain-specific knowledge base containing
      properties of the clinical data, and a knowledge-based problem-solving method for
      computing on-the-fly interpretations of these data. The purpose of the evaluation
      was to compare efficiency and user satisfaction when answering clinical queries
      of variable complexity about clinical time-oriented data using KNAVE-II, versus
      using methods available in standard clinical settings: paper chart or electronic 
      spreadsheet (ESS). Subjects answered high-complexity queries significantly faster
      using KNAVE-II than when using paper or ESS. User satisfaction with KNAVE-II was 
      significantly superior compared to satisfaction using paper or ESS, based on a
      standard usability scale. Users also explicitly ranked KNAVE-II as superior to
      paper and the ESS.

TI  - Modeling guidelines for integration into clinical workflow.
PG  - 174-8
AB  - The success of clinical decision-support systems requires that they are
      seamlessly integrated into clinical workflow. In the SAGE project, which aims to 
      create the technological infra-structure for implementing computable clinical
      practice guide-lines in enterprise settings, we created a deployment-driven
      methodology for developing guideline knowledge bases. It involves (1)
      identification of usage scenarios of guideline-based care in clinical workflow,
      (2) distillation and disambiguation of guideline knowledge relevant to these
      usage scenarios, (3) formalization of data elements and vocabulary used in the
      guideline, and (4) encoding of usage scenarios and guideline knowledge using an
      executable guideline model. This methodology makes explicit the points in the
      care process where guideline-based decision aids are appropriate and the roles of
      clinicians for whom the guideline-based assistance is intended. We have evaluated
      the methodology by simulating the deployment of an immunization guideline in a
      real clinical information system and by reconstructing the workflow context of a 
      deployed decision-support system for guideline-based care. We discuss the
      implication of deployment-driven guideline encoding for sharability of executable
      guidelines.

PG  - 125-9
AB  - Measurement of provider adherence to a guideline-based decision support system
      (DSS) presents a number of important challenges. Establishing a causal
      relationship between the DSS and change in concordance requires consideration of 
      both the primary intention of the guideline and different ways providers attempt 
      to satisfy the guideline. During our work with a guideline-based decision support
      system for hypertension, ATHENA DSS, we document a number of subtle deviations
      from the strict hypertension guideline recommendations that ultimately
      demonstrate provider adherence. We believe that understanding these complexities 
      is crucial to any valid evaluation of provider adherence. We also describe the
      development of an advisory evaluation engine that automates the interpretation of
      clinician adherence with the DSS on multiple levels, facilitating the high volume
      of complex data analysis that is created in a clinical trial of a guideline-based
      DSS.

TI  - Academic detailing to improve antihypertensive prescribing patterns.
PG  - 508-11
AB  - Several studies indicate that treatment of hypertension in the United States does
      not follow recommendations from expert bodies. We thus implemented a program
      using academic detailers to increase practitioner compliance with
      antihypertensive treatment guidelines. Five Veterans Affairs medical facilities
      including academic medical centers and community based outpatient clinics were
      chosen for the intervention. Pharmacists were trained as academic detailers, and 
      the intervention included lectures, educational materials, provider profiling,
      and meetings with 25 to 50 providers each. After intervention, the proportion of 
      hypertensives receiving calcium antagonists decreased from 43% to 38% (P <.001), 
      whereas the proportion receiving a beta blocker or thiazide diuretic increased
      from 58% to 64% (P <.001). For hypertensive subjects with diabetes mellitus or
      congestive heart failure, the proportion receiving an angiotensin converting
      enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin receptor blocker increased from 72% to 76% for
      the former and from 74% to 78% for the latter (P <.001 for both). Among
      hypertensive subjects with coronary artery disease an increase in beta blocker
      use was noted after intervention (P <.001 for change from baseline). Prescribing 
      patterns after academic detailing more closely followed national recommendations.

PG  - 589-93
AB  - The Digital Electronic Guideline Library (DeGeL) is a Web-based framework and a
      set of distributed tools that facilitate gradual conversion of clinical
      guidelines from free text, through semi-structured text, to a fully structured,
      executable representation. Thus, guidelines exist in a hybrid, multiple-format
      representation The three formats support increasingly sophisticated computational
      tasks. The tools perform semantic markup, classification, search, and browsing,
      and support computational modules that we are developing, for run-time
      application and retrospective quality assessment. We describe the DeGeL
      architecture and its collaborative-authoring authorization model, which is based 
      on (1) multiple medical-specialty authoring groups, each including a group
      manager who controls group authorizations, and (2) a hierarchical authorization
      model based on the different functions involved in the hybrid
      guideline-specification process. We have implemented the core modules of the
      DeGeL architecture and demonstrated distributed markup and retrieval using the
      knowledge roles of two guidelines ontologies (Asbru and GEM). We are currently
      evaluating several of the DeGeL tools.

TI  - Developing quality indicators and auditing protocols from formal guideline
      models: knowledge representation and transformations.
PG  - 11-5
AB  - Automated quality assessment of clinician actions and patient outcomes is a
      central problem in guideline- or standards-based medical care. In this paper we
      describe a model representation and algorithm for deriving structured quality
      indicators and auditing protocols from formalized specifications of guidelines
      used in decision support systems. We apply the model and algorithm to the
      assessment of physician concordance with a guideline knowledge model for
      hypertension used in a decision-support system. The properties of our solution
      include the ability to derive automatically context-specific and
      case-mix-adjusted quality indicators that can model global or local levels of
      detail about the guideline parameterized by defining the reliability of each
      indicator or element of the guideline.

TI  - The Effects of CPOE on ICU workflow: an observational study.
PG  - 150-4
AB  - Computerized physician order entry (CPOE) has had demonstrated benefits in error 
      reduction and guideline adherence, but its implementation has often been
      complicated by disruptions in established workflow processes. We conducted an
      observational study of the healthcare team in an intensive care unit after the
      implementation of mandatory CPOE. We found that policies designed to increase
      flexibility and safety led to an increased coordination load on the healthcare
      team, and created opportunities for new sources of error. We attribute this in
      part to implicit assumptions in the CPOE system design that execution of
      physician orders is a linear work process. Observational workflow studies are an 
      important tool to understand how to redesign CPOE systems so as to avoid harm and
      achieve the full potential of benefit for improved patient safety.

      multimedia utility elicitation for activities of daily living.
PG  - 295-9
AB  - Functional status as measured by dependencies in the Activities of Daily Living
      (ADLs) is an important indicator of overall health for older adults.
      Methodologies for outcomes-based medical-decision-making for public policy, such 
      as decision modeling and cost-effectiveness analysis, require utilities for
      outcome health states. Utilities have been reported for many disease states, but 
      have not been indexed by functional status, which is a strong predictor of
      outcome in geriatrics. We describe here a utility elicitation program developed
      specifically for use with computer-inexperienced older adults: Functional
      Limitation And Independence Rating (FLAIR1). FLAIR1 design features address
      common physical problems of the aged and computer attitudes of inexperienced
      users that could impede computer acceptance. We interviewed 400 adults ages 65
      years and older with FLAIR1. In exit interviews with 154 respondents, 118 (76%)
      found FLAIR1 easy to use. Design features in FLAIR1 can be applied to other
      software for older adults

TI  - Accuracy of computerized outpatient diagnoses in a Veterans Affairs general
      medicine clinic.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronically available data, both administrative, such as
      outpatient encounter diagnostic data, and clinical, such as problem lists, are
      being used increasingly for outcome and quality assessment, risk adjustment, and 
      clinical reminder systems. OBJECTIVE: To determine the accuracy of outpatient
      primary care diagnostic information recorded in administrative and clinical files
      in a Veterans Affairs VISTA (Veterans Health Information Systems and Technology
      Architecture) database compared with medical chart notes. STUDY DESIGN:
      Cross-sectional medical chart review of 148 patients attending a general medicine
      clinic at a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs hospital for 9 diagnoses
      relevant to the choice of drug therapy for hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An
      administrative file of encounter diagnoses, for a 2-year period, and a clinical
      file of the problem list maintained by the clinician were the sources of
      electronic diagnoses. We compared these sources with diagnoses abstracted by
      medical chart review. We estimated the sensitivity and specificity of each
      electronic data source for detecting medical chart note diagnoses. RESULTS: The
      sensitivity for 8 of the 9 study diagnoses was greater than 80% in the
      administrative file and 49% in the clinical problem list. The specificity was
      good for the administrative file (91% to 100%) and even better for the clinical
      file (98% to 100%). CONCLUSIONS: Outpatient encounter diagnoses relevant to
      hypertension recorded as electronic data had high specificity, and some codes had
      high sensitivity when collected over multiple visits. The administrative file was
      more sensitive but less specific than the clinical file. Administrative vs
      clinical files can be selected to minimize either the false-negative or the
      false-positive designations, respectively, as dictated by the needs of the
      quality assessment review.

TI  - What should be reported in a methods section on utility assessment?
PG  - 200-7
AB  - BACKGROUND: The measurement of utilities, or preferences, for health states may
      be affected by the technique used. Unfortunately, in papers reporting utilities, 
      it is often difficult to infer how the utility measurement was carried out.
      PURPOSE: To present a list of components that, when described, provide sufficient
      detail of the utility assessment. METHODS: An initial list was prepared by one of
      the authors. A panel of 8 experts was formed to add additional components. The
      components were drawn from 6 clusters that focus on the design of the study, the 
      administration procedure, the health state descriptions, the description of the
      utility assessment method, the description of the indifference procedure, and the
      use of visual aids or software programs. The list was updated and redistributed
      among a total of 14 experts, and the components were judged for their importance 
      of being mentioned in a Methods section. RESULTS: More than 40 components were
      generated. Ten components were identified as necessary to include even in an
      article not focusing on utility measurement: how utility questions were
      administered, how health states were described, which utility assessment
      method(s) was used, the response and completion rates, specification of the
      duration of the health states, which software program (if any) was used, the
      description of the worst health state (lower anchor of the scale), whether a
      matching or choice indifference search procedure was used, when the assessment
      was conducted relative to treatment, and which (if any) visual aids were used.
      The interjudge reliability was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha = 0.85).
      DISCUSSION: The list of components important for utility papers may be used in
      various ways, for instance, as a checklist while writing, reviewing, or reading a
      Methods section or while designing experiments. Guidelines are provided for a few
      components.

TI  - Integration of textual guideline documents with formal guideline knowledge bases.
PG  - 617-21
AB  - Numerous approaches have been proposed to integrate the text of guideline
      documents with guideline-based care systems. Current approaches range from
      serving marked up guideline text documents to generating advisories using complex
      guideline knowledge bases. These approaches have integration problems mainly
      because they tend to rigidly link the knowledge base with text. We are developing
      a bridge approach that uses an information retrieval technology. The new approach
      facilitates a versatile decision-support system by using flexible links between
      the formal structures of the knowledge base and the natural language style of the
      guideline text.

TI  - Patient safety in guideline-based decision support for hypertension management:
      ATHENA DSS.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - The Institute of Medicine recently issued a landmark report on medical error.1 In
      the penumbra of this report, every aspect of health care is subject to new
      scrutiny regarding patient safety. Informatics technology can support patient
      safety by correcting problems inherent in older technology; however, new
      information technology can also contribute to new sources of error. We report
      here a categorization of possible errors that may arise in deploying a system
      designed to give guideline-based advice on prescribing drugs, an approach to
      anticipating these errors in an automated guideline system, and design features
      to minimize errors and thereby maximize patient safety. Our guideline
      implementation system, based on the EON architecture, provides a framework for a 
      knowledge base that is sufficiently comprehensive to incorporate safety
      information, and that is easily reviewed and updated by clinician-experts.

TI  - Building an explanation function for a hypertension decision-support system.
PG  - 538-42
AB  - ATHENA DSS is a decision-support system that provides recommendations for
      managing hypertension in primary care. ATHENA DSS is built on a component-based
      architecture called EON. User acceptance of a system like this one depends partly
      on how well the system explains its reasoning and justifies its conclusions. We
      addressed this issue by adapting WOZ, a declarative explanation framework, to
      build an explanation function for ATHENA DSS. ATHENA DSS is built based on a
      component-based architecture called EON. The explanation function obtains its
      information by tapping into EON's components, as well as into other relevant
      sources such as the guideline document and medical literature. It uses an
      argument model to identify the pieces of information that constitute an
      explanation, and employs a set of visual clients to display that explanation. By 
      incorporating varied information sources, by mirroring naturally occurring
      medical arguments and by utilizing graphic visualizations, ATHENA DSS's
      explanation function generates rich, evidence-based explanations.

TI  - Ethical decision making and patient autonomy: a comparison of physicians and
      patients in Japan and the United States.
PG  - 1172-82
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-centered decision making, which in the United States is
      typically considered to be appropriate, may not be universally endorsed, thereby 
      harboring the potential to complicate the care of patients from other cultural
      backgrounds in potentially unrecognized ways. This study compares the attitudes
      toward ethical decision making and autonomy issues among academic and community
      physicians and patients of medical center outpatient clinics in Japan and the
      United States. METHODS: A questionnaire requesting judgments about seven clinical
      vignettes was distributed (in English or Japanese) to sample groups of Japanese
      physicians (n = 400) and patients (n = 65) as well as US physicians (n = 120) and
      patients (n = 60) that were selected randomly from academic institutions and
      community settings in Japan (Tokyo and the surrounding area) and the United
      States (the Stanford/Palo Alto, CA, area). Responses were obtained from 273
      Japanese physicians (68%), 58 Japanese patients (89%), 98 US physicians (82%),
      and 55 US patients (92%). Physician and patient sample groups were compared on
      individual items, and composite scores were derived from subsets of items
      relevant to patient autonomy, family authority, and physician authority. RESULTS:
      A majority of both US physicians and patients, but only a minority of Japanese
      physicians and patients, agreed that a patient should be informed of an incurable
      cancer diagnosis before their family is informed and that a terminally ill
      patient wishing to die immediately should not be ventilated, even if both the
      doctor and the patient's family want the patient ventilated (Japanese physicians 
      and patients vs US physicians and patients, p < 0.001). A majority of respondents
      in both Japanese sample groups, but only a minority in both US sample groups,
      agreed that a patient's family should be informed of an incurable cancer
      diagnosis before the patient is informed and that the family of an HIV-positive
      patient should be informed of this disease status despite the patient's
      opposition to such disclosure (Japanese physicians and patients vs US physicians 
      and patients, p < 0.001). Physicians in both Japan and the United States were
      less likely than patients in their respective countries to agree with physician
      assistance in the suicide of a terminally ill patient (Japanese physicians and
      patients vs US physicians and patients, p < 0.05). Across various clinical
      scenarios, all four respondent groups accorded greatest authority to the patient,
      less to the family, and still less to the physician when the views of these
      persons conflicted. Japanese physicians and patients, however, relied more on
      family and physician authority and placed less emphasis on patient autonomy than 
      the US physicians and patients sampled. Younger respondents placed less emphasis 
      on family and physician authority. CONCLUSIONS: Family and physician opinions are
      accorded a larger role in clinical decision making by the Japanese physicians and
      patients sampled than by those in the United States, although both cultures place
      a greater emphasis on patient preferences than on the preferences of the family
      or physician. Our results are consistent with the view that cultural context
      shapes the relationship of the patient, the physician, and the patient's family
      in medical decision making. The results emphasize the need for clinicians to be
      aware of these issues that may affect patient and family responses in different
      clinical situations, potentially affecting patient satisfaction and compliance
      with therapy.

TI  - Implementing clinical practice guidelines while taking account of changing
      evidence: ATHENA DSS, an easily modifiable decision-support system for managing
      hypertension in primary care.
PG  - 300-4
AB  - This paper describes the ATHENA Decision Support System (DSS), which
      operationalizes guidelines for hypertension using the EON architecture. ATHENA
      DSS encourages blood pressure control and recommends guideline-concordant choice 
      of drug therapy in relation to comorbid diseases. ATHENA DSS has an easily
      modifiable knowledge base that specifies eligibility criteria, risk
      stratification, blood pressure targets, relevant comorbid diseases,
      guideline-recommended drug classes for patients with comorbid disease, preferred 
      drugs within each drug class, and clinical messages. Because evidence for best
      management of hypertension evolves continually, ATHENA DSS is designed to allow
      clinical experts to customize the knowledge base to incorporate new evidence or
      to reflect local interpretations of guideline ambiguities. Together with its
      database mediator Athenaeum, ATHENA DSS has physical and logical data
      independence from the legacy Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS) supplying 
      the patient data, so it can be integrated into a variety of electronic medical
      record systems.

TI  - Postoperative complications in Parkinson's disease.
PG  - 967-72
AB  - BACKGROUND: Although Parkinson's disease is relatively common in America, with an
      average annual incidence of 20 cases per 100,000 population, little information
      exists about postoperative morbidity and mortality in those Parkinson's patients 
      who undergo elective surgery. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study 
      using the Veterans Affairs (VA) Austin database system (a cumulative index of
      admissions and discharges from all US VA Medical Centers) to identify 41,213
      patients who underwent elective bowel resection, cholecystectomy, or radical
      prostatectomy between January 1, 1990, and December 31, 1995. We examined the
      study population using univariate analysis, acute length of stay with
      multivariate analysis, and postoperative complications with logistic regression. 
      RESULTS: The selected surgeries were performed on 234 patients with a diagnosis
      of Parkinson's disease and 40,979 with no such diagnosis. In univariate analysis,
      patients with Parkinson's disease had significantly longer acute hospital stays
      than non-Parkinson's patients (11.4 +/- 15.9 days vs 8.8 +/- 9.0 days, P < .001).
      In addition, Parkinson's patients had a higher in-hospital mortality than
      non-Parkinson's patients (7.3% vs 3.8%, P = .006). After we adjusted for
      coexisting morbidity, age, admitting location, and gender, patients with
      Parkinson's disease had an average acute hospital stay 2.34 days longer than that
      of non-Parkinson's patients (P < .001). However, the mortality difference did not
      reach statistical significance in multivariate analysis (P = .098). Finally,
      Parkinson's patients had significantly increased incidences of urinary-tract
      infection (odds ratio 2.045, P < .001), aspiration pneumonia (odds ratio 3.825, P
      < .001), and bacterial infections (odds ratio 1.682, P < .001). CONCLUSIONS:
      Patients with Parkinson's disease are at greater risk for specific complications 
      and longer hospital stay after elective bowel resection, cholecystectomy, or
      radical prostatectomy. Awareness of these complications may help caregivers to
      reduce postoperative mortality and morbidity and to decrease the length of
      hospitalization.

TI  - The influence of physician race, age, and gender on physician attitudes toward
      advance care directives and preferences for end-of-life decision-making.
PG  - 579-91
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether physicians' preferences for end-of-life
      decision-making differ between blacks and whites in the same pattern as patient
      preferences, with blacks being more likely than whites to prefer life-prolonging 
      treatments. DESIGN: A mailed survey. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: American Medical
      Association (AMA) and National Medical Association (NMA) databases. To enrich the
      sample of black physicians, we targeted physicians in the AMA database practicing
      in high minority area zip codes and graduates of the traditionally black medical 
      schools. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Self-reported physician attitudes toward
      end-of-life decision-making and preference of treatment for themselves in
      persistent vegetative state or organic brain disease compared by race,
      controlling for age and gender. RESULTS: The 502 physicians (28%) who returned
      the questionnaire included 280 white and 157 black physicians. With regard to
      attitudes toward patient care, 58% of white physicians agreed that tube-feeding
      in terminally ill patients is "heroic," but only 28 % of black physicians agreed 
      with the statement (P < .001). White physicians were more likely than black
      physicians to find physician-assisted suicide an acceptable treatment alternative
      (36.6% vs 26.5% of black physicians) (P < .05). With regard to the physicians
      preferences for future treatment of themselves for the persistent vegetative
      state scenario, black physicians were more than six times more likely than white 
      physicians to request aggressive treatments (cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
      mechanical ventilation, or artificial feeding) for themselves (15.4% vs 2.5%) (P 
      < .001). White physicians were almost three times as likely to want
      physician-assisted suicide (29.3% vs 11.8%) (P < .001) in this scenario. For a
      state of brain damage with no terminal illness, the majority of all physicians
      did not want aggressive treatment, but black physicians were nearly five times
      more likely than white physicians (23.0% vs 5.0%) (P < .001) to request these
      treatments. White physicians, on the other hand, were more than twice as likely
      to request physician-assisted suicide (22.5% vs 9.9%), P < .001 in this scenario.
      CONCLUSIONS: Physicians preferences for end-of-life treatment follow the same
      pattern by race as patient preferences, making it unlikely that low socioeconomic
      status or lack of familiarity with treatments account for the difference.
      Self-denoted race may be a surrogate marker for other, as yet undefined, factors.
      The full spectrum of treatment preferences should be considered in development of
      guidelines for end-of-life treatment in our diverse society.

TI  - Finger and penile tactile sensitivity in sexually functional and dysfunctional
      diabetic men.
PG  - 336-42
AB  - Tactile sensitivity of the penis is related to sexual functioning, however its
      role in diabetic erectile problems is unclear. We evaluated penile sensitivity in
      10 diabetic men with erectile dysfunction, 17 sexually functional diabetic men
      and 14 control subjects. Finger and penile thresholds and ratings of intensity
      and pleasantness for finger and penis were assessed using vibrotactile
      stimulation. Glycosylated haemoglobin and total and bioavailable testosterone
      measurements were determined and subjects completed self-reports on sexual
      function. Diabetic men with erectile problems had higher values of glycosylated
      haemoglobin than sexually functional diabetic men (p = 0.02) and both groups had 
      lower bioavailable testosterone than control subjects (p< or =0.05). Sexually
      dysfunctional diabetic men had a higher finger threshold than the other two
      groups (p<0.01). Penile threshold for the sexually dysfunctional group was also
      marginally higher compared with the functional diabetic group (p<0.052) but did
      not differ from control subjects (p = 0.09). Diabetic men with erectile
      dysfunction exhibited different response patterns than sexually functional men on
      dimensions of intensity and pleasantness to penile stimulation. Although these
      data do not directly implicate subjective response to penile stimulation in
      diabetic erectile problems, they suggest such anomalous response could be one
      contributing factor.

      database: the ATHENA and EON projects at Stanford.
PG  - 653-7
AB  - We present a methodology and database mediator tool for integrating modern
      knowledge-based systems, such as the Stanford EON architecture for automated
      guideline-based decision-support, with legacy databases, such as the Veterans
      Health Information Systems & Technology Architecture (VISTA) systems, which are
      used nation-wide. Specifically, we discuss designs for database integration in
      ATHENA, a system for hypertension care based on EON, at the VA Palo Alto Health
      Care System. We describe a new database mediator that affords the EON system both
      physical and logical data independence from the legacy VA database. We found that
      to achieve our design goals, the mediator requires two separate mapping levels
      and must itself involve a knowledge-based component.

TI  - Decision analysis and Alzheimer disease: three case studies.
PG  - 71-83
AB  - Decision analysis may be useful to people facing Alzheimer disease (AD)
      decisions. The use of decision analysis in three such cases is reported. The
      first case involved a middle-aged person worried about early-onset AD and
      deciding whether to seek genetic testing. The analysis let the participant reject
      testing and consider innovative care options. The second case involved a
      middle-aged person concerned about later-onset AD. The analysis for her was more 
      complex, and led to the assignment of some limited value on genetic testing for
      her. The third case revolved around a caregiver's treatment decisions for a
      patient with severe AD. It led her to recognize the importance of factors she had
      not previously considered. In each of the three cases, the intensive process of
      decision analysis appears to have improved the subject's decision.

AB  - The availability of genetic tests to diagnose or predict Alzheimer disease (AD)
      causes a shift in the way people think about the condition and how they assess
      the options available to them. Decision analysis in a quantitative approach for
      dealing with the uncertainties inherent in many medical decisions, including
      decisions about genetic testing. Decision analysis does not guarantee a good
      outcome, but aims to yield better overall average results by providing a
      framework for people to evaluate their options and minimize cognitive biases. We 
      provide an overview of the decision analysis process, including the terms and
      tools commonly associated with it. We also use a recent example to demonstrate
      one way decision analysis has been applied to genetics in the medical literature.
      This paper is an introduction to subsequent papers that explore the specific
      question of whether decision analysis is a helpful tool for understanding the
      uncertainty inherent in probabilistic information about genetic risk for AD.

TI  - The effect of search procedures on utility elicitations.
PG  - 76-83
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Elicited preferences for health states vary among scaling methods,
      manners of describing health states, and other features of the elicitation
      process. The authors examined the effects of changing the search procedure for a 
      subject's utility on mean utility values. METHODS: A randomized controlled trial 
      of two search procedures (titration and "ping-pong") using two otherwise
      identical computer programs that describe health states related to Gaucher's
      disease, then measuring subjects' preferences. SETTING: Paid, healthy volunteers 
      recruited from the community through advertisements. RESULTS: The mean time
      tradeoff (TTO) and standard gamble (SG) utility values for life with severe
      anemia and splenomegaly and life with chronic bone pain from Gaucher's disease
      were between 0.10 and 0.15 higher with the titration search procedure than with
      the ping-pong procedure. Effects of the search procedure were additive with
      variability due to scaling methods, resulting in mean differences in utility
      ratings for the same health state of as much as 0.28 among procedures and scaling
      methods. Effects of search procedures on utility values persisted on repeated
      testing at week 2 and week 3; there was no evidence of convergence to a single
      "true" utility value over time. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure used to search for
      subjects' utility values strongly influences the results of preference-assessment
      experiments. Effects of search procedures persist on repeated testing. The
      results suggest that utility values are heavily influenced by, if not created
      during, the process of elicitation. Thus, utility values elicited using different
      search procedures may not be directly comparable.

TI  - Measurement of the validity of utility elicitations performed by computerized
      interview.
PG  - 915-20
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The authors evaluate a measure of the validity of utility
      elicitations and study the potential effects of invalid elicitations on
      population utility values. METHODS: The authors used a computerized survey to
      describe and measure preferences for three common side-effects of anti-psychotic 
      drugs (tardive dyskinesia [TD], akathesia [AKA], pseudo-parkinsonism). The
      authors compared the validity of elicitations in 41 healthy volunteers to 22
      schizophrenic patients. Preferences were measured using visual analog scale
      (VAS), pair-wise comparison (PWC), and the Standard Gamble (SG) methods. To
      assess the validity of each groups' responses, the authors compared the
      consistency of subjects' rank-order of the desirability of states across methods 
      of preferences assessment (CAMPA). RESULTS: All healthy volunteers and 82% of
      patients completed the computer survey; of these subjects, 97% of healthy
      volunteers and 70% of patients indicated they thought they understood the task
      required of them. However, only 78% of healthy subjects and 44% of patients had a
      consistent rank ordering of preferences among VAS and PWC ratings; only 80% and
      61%, respectively, had a consistent rank ordering preferences among SG and PWC
      ratings. For two of the three health states, inconsistent subjects had
      statistically higher SG utilities (for TD, 0.94 versus 0.87, and for AKA 0.92
      versus 0.86; P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The CAMPA test can identify potentially
      invalid preference ratings. Potentially invalid preference ratings may bias the
      "population" utilities for health states.

TI  - The effect of assessment method and respondent population on utilities elicited
      for Gaucher disease.
PG  - 169-84
AB  - Measured preferences have been reported to vary with the method of elicitation
      and respondent population surveyed. We elicited utilities for Gaucher disease
      using a multimedia implementation of the time trade-off, standard gamble, and a
      conceptually different, largely untested approach, the risk-risk trade-off, from 
      those who are healthy, those with a chronic illness and those with Gaucher
      disease. The risk-risk trade-off produced significantly lower utilities than the 
      other two preference assessment methods and had the poorest test-retest
      reliability. The respondent's self-rated current health state utility was the
      most important determinant of utility values elicited by the time trade-off and
      standard gamble for the hypothetical health states. Our results do not support
      the use of our implementation of the risk-risk trade-off method. In eliciting
      preferences for hypothetical health states from the general population, the
      subjective rating of a respondent's own health state should be considered in
      determining representative population groups.

AB  - Culture is not something apart from us. It is always here, and we, like fish in
      an ocean, may be blind to the water in which we swim. We recommend that, in
      addition to learning as much as possible about people from cultures other than
      our own, we consider carefully the cultural roots of our own thoughts and
      actions. A combination of respectful behavior and a conscientious effort to
      understand individuals from another culture will go far in enabling us to work
      well with dying patients from many backgrounds.

TI  - Developing and testing a multimedia presentation of a health-state description.
PG  - 336-44
AB  - Quality-adjustment weights for health states are an essential component of
      cost-utility analysis (CUA). Quality-adjustment weights are obtained by
      presenting large numbers of subjects with multiattribute descriptions of health
      states for rating. Comprehending multiattribute health states is a difficult task
      for most respondents. The authors hypothesized that multimedia (MM) presentation 
      using computers might facilitate this task better than would a paper-based text
      (Text). To test this hypothesis, they developed closely matched MM and Text
      descriptions of health states in the first-person narrative style, and developed 
      a method of testing the presentation of a health state. Subjects were randomized 
      to exposure to either MM or Text and subject recall of the health state and
      recognition of features of the health state were tested. How well defined the
      preferences of the subjects were after each presentation method was assessed by
      having the subjects mark on a double-anchored visual-analog scale the "best" and 
      "worst" they believed the quality of life in the health state might be. MM
      subjects had better recall (11.85 vs 9.44 of a total of 24 meaning units, p =
      0.098) and better recognition (4.71 vs 4.22, p = 0.08). The average interval
      between the "best" and "worst" ratings was shorter for the MM subjects (2.19 cm
      vs 3.26 cm, p = 0.12).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)

TI  - Intensity of treatment in malnutrition. The ethical considerations.
PG  - 191-206
AB  - Decisions about initiation and withdrawal of life-sustaining artificial nutrition
      and hydration are complex and sometimes are agonizing to make. Artificial feeding
      is considered by most medical ethicists to be a medical intervention about which 
      decisions should be made based on the benefits, risks, and burdens of the
      treatment. State law varies, particularly with regard to the inclusion of
      artificial feeding in advance directives and in laws about its discontinuance.
      Conditions in which it is common for patients or families to consider refusal of 
      artificial feeding include terminal cancer, advanced dementia, and persistent
      vegetative state. Alternative approaches to nutrition, such as offering favorite 
      foods or treating underlying depression, may obviate the need for tube feeding.
      Competent patients may refuse any medical treatment, including life-sustaining
      treatment. An appropriate proxy decision maker may also refuse treatment on
      behalf of a mentally incapacitated patient.

TI  - Ethical dilemmas in the critically ill elderly.
PG  - 91-101
AB  - Elderly people in the United States often receive treatment through an enormous
      array of medical technology when they become critically ill. Some, or all, such
      interventions may be unwanted, and patients have the right to be informed about
      what prospects lie ahead. CPR, with survival rates of 2% to 20%, rarely has the
      effect for which it was intended, as studies over the last two decades have
      repeatedly demonstrated. Although it is not clear that elderly people are at
      higher risk for poor outcomes of CPR, it is clear most of them do not possess
      sufficient knowledge about either CPR or its usual outcome to make an informed
      choice. Ideally, an individual should choose his or her own resuscitation status,
      but evidence exists indicating surrogates more often than not make this decision.
      This is unfortunate, because both surrogates and physicians are poor judges of
      patients' resuscitation preferences. Advance directives, especially when coupled 
      with effective physician-patient communication, will aid elderly persons in
      making decisions about life support. We encourage all physicians who care for the
      elderly to avert many of tomorrow's ethical dilemmas by communicating with their 
      healthy patients today.

TI  - A multimedia preference-assessment tool for functional outcomes.
PG  - 844-8
AB  - Functional outcomes of clinical trials are often reported as number of
      dependencies in activities of daily living (ADLs). Quality-weighting for the ADLs
      has not been reported. We designed and pilot-tested ADLIB (ADL Index Builder), a 
      multimedia computer program, that presents ADL health states to subjects and
      elicits from subjects a rating for the quality of life of each health state.
      Subjects, who were patients over age 50 without previous computer experience,
      found the program easy to use. Health care professionals specializing in
      geriatrics confirmed that the ADL presentations used in the program are in accord
      with typical practice in scoring ADLs. We plan to use the program to obtain
      population-based preference ratings that can be used to assess efficacy of
      clinical trials and to provide quality-weights for cost-effectiveness analysis.

TI  - Durable power of attorney for health care. A survey of senior center
      participants.
PG  - 292-6
AB  - Fifty-nine healthy senior center participants were interviewed to determine how, 
      when, and why the durable power of attorney for health care is being used. The 21
      users of the durable power of attorney for health care executed a form for the
      expected reasons; however, a majority had not given a copy of the form to their
      physician and few had discussed details of their preferences with the proxy. Of
      the 38 nonusers, the most frequent reasons for not executing a durable power of
      attorney for health care were: lack of awareness of the form, procrastination,
      and difficulty choosing a proxy. The new Patient Self-Determination Act requiring
      hospitals to inform patients of advance directives will help to overcome some of 
      the obstacles in use of the durable power of attorney for health care; however,
      community education must still be encouraged.

TI  - Durable power of attorney for health care. Are we ready for it?
PG  - 263-8
AB  - Health care professionals need to be well informed about advance directives for
      medical care in the event a patient becomes incapacitated. The Patient
      Self-Determination Act requires that all patients be advised of their options at 
      the time of hospital admission. Hospitals and health care professionals will need
      to work together to plan for implementing this law. We surveyed 215 physicians,
      nurses, and social workers at a Veterans Affairs Medical Center about the
      California advance directive, the Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care.
      Attitudes were generally positive. All of the social workers had heard of the
      durable power of attorney directive, but 36% of physicians and nurses had never
      heard of it and an additional 20% had no experience with one. For respondents who
      had heard of the directive, the mean knowledge score was 6.35 of a possible 10 (5
      predicted by chance). Respondents brought up the issue of durable power of
      attorney with patients before a crisis only 19% of the time and determined
      whether one had been signed for only 16% of older patients in hospital. The most 
      commonly cited reasons for failure to discuss this with patients were lack of
      proper forms, pamphlets, or a place to refer a patient. Of those who had ever
      seen such a document in use, 42% were aware of a problem with it at some time.
      Whereas attitudes toward advance directives are positive, many physicians and
      nurses had little knowledge of the Durable Power of Attorney for Health Care and 
      were poorly equipped to discuss it with patients. We encourage educating hospital
      staff to prepare for the enactment of the Patient Self-Determination Act. We also
      recommend that the concerns raised by professionals about the use of a durable
      power of attorney be addressed.

TI  - Screening for frailty: criteria and predictors of outcomes.
PG  - 778-84
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine the reliability of rapid screening by clinically derived 
      geriatric criteria in predicting outcomes of elderly hospitalized patients.
      DESIGN: Prospective cohort study of 985 patients screened at the time of hospital
      admission and followed for 1 year with respect to the outcomes of mortality,
      hospital readmission, and nursing home utilization. SETTING: Palo Alto Veterans
      Affairs Medical Center, a tertiary care teaching hospital. SUBJECTS: Male
      patients 65 years of age and older admitted to the Medical and Surgical services 
      during the period from October 1, 1985 through September 30, 1986. RESULTS:
      Patients were grouped by specific screening criteria into three groups of
      increasing frailty: Independent, Frail, and Severely Impaired. Each criterion
      focused on a geriatric condition and was designed to serve as a marker for
      frailty. Increasing frailty was significantly correlated with increasing length
      of hospital stay (P less than 0.0001), nursing home utilization (P less than
      0.0001), and mortality (P less than 0.0001). Multivariate analyses revealed that 
      the clinical groups were more predictive of mortality and nursing home
      utilization than were age or Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). Rehospitalization
      was unrelated to age, clinical group, or DRG, suggesting that utilization may not
      be driven by the clinical factors measured in this study. CONCLUSIONS: Rapid
      clinical screening using specific geriatric criteria is effective in identifying 
      frail older subjects at risk for mortality and nursing home utilization. Our
      findings suggest that geriatric syndromes are more predictive of adverse outcomes
      than diagnosis per se. This well operationalized screening process is inexpensive
      as well as effective and could easily be introduced into other hospital settings.

TI  - Gynecologic factors in sexual dysfunction of the older woman.
PG  - 41-61
AB  - Older women may experience sexual dysfunction due to many different causes. Some 
      problems related to menopausal hormonal change may be easily treated with
      estrogen supplements. Other problems involve intricate interpersonal relations
      between the woman and her sexual partner and may require a combination of medical
      therapy and sexual counseling. Gynecologic cancer and cancer treatments are often
      accompanied by problems in sexual functioning. These problems may then impair
      relations and self-image, leading to a vicious circle of deteriorating social
      function. Some recommendations for the clinician follow. The clinician should
      maintain an attitude of openness to the possibility of sexual concerns in older
      women. Such concerns should be taken seriously and should not be dismissed as
      part of aging. Routine periodic health examinations can include a question such
      as "Do you have any concerns about your sexual life that you would like to
      discuss?" In follow-up visits for procedures with a high likelihood of causing
      sexual dysfunction, questions that would open the door to a discussion of
      sexuality should be asked. Sexual dysfunction should be recognized as a
      couple-oriented phenomenon. A woman's anxiety about her appearance, postoperative
      depression, or dyspareunia may be perceived by her partner as a sexual rejection 
      and may initiate a cycle of decreasing contact or may even lead to erectile
      dysfunction. Sexual counseling should include both partners. When a surgical
      procedure that will probably have an impact on sexual function is contemplated,
      provide the patient and her partner with advance counseling. Descriptions of
      surgery should not be simply a statement of body parts to be removed but should
      specifically address the anticipated sexual effects. Counseling should include a 
      description of basic anatomy and function of the genital organs. Illustrations
      and appropriate demonstration during the physical examination should be used to
      ensure the patient's understanding. Descriptions should be accurate without being
      either frightening or falsely reassuring. The patient should be counseled about
      the benefits of including her partner in discussions. Then, when possible, the
      sexual partner of the patient should be invited to sessions of advance counseling
      on contemplated procedures. Clinicians should remain open to the possibility that
      the sexual partner will be a nontraditional one, e.g., an unmarried male partner 
      or another woman. The clinician should be alert to remediable causes of
      dysfunction. For example, decreased vaginal lubrication may be managed with use
      of water-soluble lubricants.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)

TI  - Improving Patient Safety Using ATHENA-Decision Support System Technology: The
      Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain Experience
BTI - Advances in Patient Safety: New Directions and Alternative Approaches (Vol. 4:
      Technology and Medication Safety)
AB  - The purpose of this paper is to describe potential improvements in patient safety
      resulting from design decisions in the development of a computerized decision
      support system (DSS) for managing opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain.
      ATHENA-DSS is an automated decision support system developed in a collaboration
      between Stanford University and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to
      increase guideline-adherent prescribing and to change physician behavior. Based
      on data in patients' computerized medical record and knowledge of the clinical
      domain encoded in a knowledge base, the system gives patient-specific
      recommendations to primary care providers at the point of care. ATHENA-Opioid
      Therapy is based on a previous system, ATHENA-Hypertension, and is designed to
      follow the VA/Department of Defense clinical practice guideline for the
      management of opioid therapy for chronic noncancer pain. We describe the
      rationale for development of decision support system elements and a graphical
      user interface to increase patient safety during primary care treatment for
      chronic pain. The ATHENA-Opioid Therapy system focuses on reducing patient risk
      in four main ways by: (1) identifying patients with comorbidities or concurrent
      prescriptions that raise risk for overdose and recommending more conservative
      dosing; (2) identifying patients with mental health problems that increase risk
      of medication abuse and recommending referral to psychiatric care and close
      monitoring; (3) assisting doctors with complex pharmacologic calculations to
      reduce the risk of mistakes when initiating, titrating, or switching medications;
      and (4) presenting relevant information to clinicians in an easy-to-use format.
      We describe a system evaluation plan that we believe is essential to ensure that 
      deployment of ATHENA-Opioid Therapy leads to improvements in patient safety and
      increases in guideline-concordant prescribing, and we discuss the limitations of 
      this system for patient safety efforts.

AB  - Quality assurance (QA) processes for new technologies are used to ensure safety. 
      Clinical decision support systems (DSS), identified by the Institute of Medicine 
      (IOM) as an important tool in preventing patient errors, should undergo similar
      predeployment testing to prevent introduction of new errors. Post-fielding
      surveillance, akin to post-marketing surveillance for adverse events, may detect 
      rarely occurring problems that appear only in widespread use. To assess the
      quality of a guideline-based DSS for hypertension, ATHENA DSS, researchers
      monitored real-time clinician feedback during point-of-care use of the system.
      Comments (n = 835) were submitted by 44 of the 91 (48.4 percent) study clinicians
      (median 8.5 comments/ clinician). Twenty-three (2.8 percent) comments identified 
      important, rarely occurring problems. Timely analysis of such feedback revealed
      omissions of medications, diagnoses, and adverse drug reactions due to rare
      events in data extraction and conversion from the electronic health record.
      Analysis of clinician-user feedback facilitated rapid detection and correction of
      such errors. Based on this experience, new technologies for improving patient
      safety should include mechanisms for post-fielding QA testing.

BTI - Closing the Quality Gap: A Critical Analysis of Quality Improvement Strategies
      (Vol. 3: Hypertension Care)
AB  - Hypertension affects more than 50 million people in the United States alone.
      Despite clear evidence regarding the beneficial effects of quality treatment for 
      high blood pressure, many millions of diagnosed and undiagnosed hypertensives are
      not receiving the optimal standard of care. The difference in patient outcomes
      achieved with present hypertension treatment methods and those thought to be
      possible using best practice treatment methods is known as a quality gap, and
      such gaps are at least partly responsible for the loss of thousands of lives each
      year. This review was organized to bring a systematic assessment of different
      quality improvement (QI) strategies and their effects to the process of
      identifying and managing hypertension. Investigators searched the MEDLINE(R)
      database, the Cochrane Collaboration's Effective Practice and Organisation of
      Care (EPOC) registry, article bibliographies, and relevant journals for
      experimental evaluations of QI interventions aimed at improving hypertension
      screening and management of non-pregnant adults with primary hypertension. The
      reviewers included randomized or quasi-randomized controlled trials, controlled
      before-after studies, and interrupted time series in which at least one reported 
      outcome measure included changes in blood pressure, or provider or patient
      adherence to a recommended process of care. Relevant data were abstracted
      independently by two reviewers. Each QI intervention was classified into one or
      more of the following components: provider education, provider reminders,
      facilitated relay of clinical information, patient education, promotion of
      self-management, patient reminders, audit and feedback, organizational change, or
      financial incentives. Certain categories were further subdivided into major
      subtypes (e.g., professional meetings for provider education and disease
      management for organizational change). The researchers also evaluated the impact 
      of clinical information systems as a mediator for interventions of all types.
      They compared the different QI strategies in terms of the median effects achieved
      for blood pressure control and for a generalized measure of provider or patient
      adherence. Sixty-three articles reporting a total of 82 comparisons met the
      inclusion criteria. Studies of hypertension identification were found to be too
      heterogeneous for quantitative analysis. The majority of screening studies were
      clinic-based (with a few offered at work sites), and the most common strategies
      involved patient and/or provider reminders. These generally showed positive
      results; several studies found that patients were more likely to know their blood
      pressure or attend clinic visits after receiving reminders. Across all studies
      with a variety of strategies, the median reductions in systolic blood pressure
      (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were 4.5 mmHg (interquartile range: 1.5,
      11.0) and 2.1 mmHg (interquartile range: -0.2, 5.0), respectively. The median
      increase in the proportion of patients in the target SBP range and target DBP
      range was 16.2 percent (interquartile range: 10.3, 32.2), and 6.0 percent
      (interquartile range: 1.5, 17.5), respectively. Studies that focused on improving
      provider adherence showed a range of median reduction of 1.3 percent to a median 
      improvement of 3.3 percent across all QI strategies. Overall, patient adherence
      showed a median improvement of 2.8 percent (interquartile range: 1.9, 3.0). The
      findings of this review suggest that QI strategies appear, in general, to be
      associated with the improved identification and control of hypertension. It is
      not possible to discern with complete confidence which specific QI strategies
      have the greatest effects, since most of the studies included more than one QI
      strategy. All of the assessed strategies may be beneficial under some
      circumstances, and in varying combinations. There may be other useful strategies 
      that have not been studied in trials meeting the inclusion criteria for
      evidence-based review; it is not possible to draw conclusions about these
      strategies.

TI  - Prescribers' responses to alerts during medication ordering in the long
      term care setting.
PG  - 385-90
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Computerized physician order entry with clinical decision
      support has been shown to improve medication safety in adult inpatients,
      but few data are available regarding its usefulness in the long-term care
      setting. The objective of this study was to examine opportunities for
      improving medication safety in that clinical setting by determining the
      proportion of medication orders that would generate a warning message to
      the prescriber via a computerized clinical decision support system and
      assessing the extent to which these alerts would affect prescribers'
      actions. DESIGN: The study was set within a randomized controlled trial of
      computerized clinical decision support conducted in the long-stay units of
      a large, academically-affiliated long-term care facility. In March 2002, a
      computer-based clinical decision support system (CDSS) was added to an
      existing computerized physician order entry (CPOE) system. Over a
      subsequent one-year study period, prescribers ordering drugs for residents
      on three resident-care units of the facility were presented with alerts;
      these alerts were not displayed to prescribers in the four control units.
      MEASUREMENTS: We assessed the frequency of drug orders associated with
      various categories of alerts across all participating units of the
      facility. To assess the impact of actually receiving an alert on
      prescriber behavior during drug ordering, we calculated separately for the
      intervention and control units the proportion of the alerts, within each
      category, that were followed by an appropriate action and estimated the
      relative risk of an appropriate action in the intervention units compared
      to the control units. RESULTS: During the 12 months of the study, there
      were 445 residents on the participating units of the facility,
      contributing 3,726 resident-months of observation time. During this
      period, 47,997 medication orders were entered through the CPOE
      system-approximately 9 medication orders per resident per month. 9,414
      alerts were triggered (2.5 alerts per resident-month). The alert
      categories most often triggered were related to risks of central nervous
      system side-effects such as over-sedation (20%). Alerts for risk of
      drug-associated constipation (13%) or renal insufficiency/electrolyte
      imbalance (12%) were also common. Twelve percent of the alerts were
      related to orders for warfarin. Overall, prescribers who received alerts
      were only slightly more likely to take an appropriate action (relative
      risk 1.11, 95% confidence interval 1.00, 1.22). Alerts related to orders
      for warfarin or central nervous system side effects were most likely to
      engender an appropriate action, such as ordering a recommended laboratory
      test or canceling an ordered drug. CONCLUSION: Long-term care facilities
      must implement new system-level approaches with the potential to improve
      medication safety for their residents. The number of medication orders
      that triggered a warning message in this study suggests that CPOE with a
      clinical decision support system may represent one such tool. However, the
      relatively low rate of response to these alerts suggests that further
      refinements to such systems are required, and that their impact on
      medication errors and adverse drug events must be carefully assessed.

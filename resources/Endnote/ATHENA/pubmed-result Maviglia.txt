TI  - Automating complex guidelines for chronic disease: lessons learned.
PG  - 154-65
AB  - There is scant published experience with implementing complex, multistep
      computerized practice guidelines for the long-term management of chronic
      diseases. We have implemented a system for creating, maintaining, and
      navigating computer-based clinical algorithms integrated with our
      electronic medical record. This article describes our progress and reports
      on lessons learned that might guide future work in this field. We discuss
      issues and obstacles related to choosing and adapting a guideline for
      electronic implementation, representing and executing the guideline as a
      computerized algorithm, and integrating it into the clinical workflow of
      outpatient care. Although obstacles were encountered at each of these
      steps, the most difficult were related to workflow integration.

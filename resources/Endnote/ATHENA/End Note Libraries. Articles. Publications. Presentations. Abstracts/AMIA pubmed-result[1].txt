TI  - Offline Testing of the ATHENA Hypertension Decision Support System
      Knowledge Base to Improve the Accuracy of Recommendations.
PG  - 539-43
AB  - ATHENA-HTN is a clinical decision support system (CDSS) that delivers
      guideline-based patient-specific recommendations about hypertension
      management at the time of clinical decision-making. The ATHENA-HTN
      knowledge is stored in a knowledge-base (KB). Changes in best-practice
      recommendations require updates to the KB. We describe a method of offline
      testing to evaluate the accuracy of recommendations generated from the KB.
      A physician reviewed 100 test cases and made drug recommendations based on
      guidelines and the "Rules" (descriptions of encoded knowledge). These drug
      recommendations were compared to those generated by ATHENA-HTN. Nineteen
      drug-recommendation discrepancies were identified: ATHENA-HTN was more
      complete in generating recommendations (15); ambiguities in the Rules
      misled the physician (3); and content in the Rules was not encoded (1).
      Three new boundaries were identified. Three updates were made to the KB
      based on the results. The offline testing method was successful in
      identifying areas for KB improvement and led to improved accuracy of
      guideline-based recommendations.

TI  - Identifying barriers to hypertension guideline adherence using clinician
      feedback at the point of care.
PG  - 494-8
AB  - Factors contributing to low adherence to clinical guidelines by clinicians
      are not well understood. The user interface of ATHENA-HTN, a
      guideline-based decision support system (DSS) for hypertension, presents a
      novel opportunity to collect clinician feedback on recommendations
      displayed at the point of care. We analyzed feedback from 46 clinicians
      who received ATHENA advisories as part of a 15-month randomized trial to
      identify potential reasons clinicians may not intensify hypertension
      therapy when it is recommended. Among the 368 visits for which feedback
      was provided, clinicians commonly reported they did not follow
      recommendations because: recorded blood pressure was not representative of
      the patient's typical blood pressure; hypertension was not a clinical
      priority for the visit; or patients were nonadherent to medications. For
      many visits, current quality-assurance algorithms may incorrectly identify
      clinically appropriate decisions as guideline nonadherent due to
      incomplete capture of relevant information. We present recommendations for
      how automated DSSs may help identify "apparent" barriers and better target
      decision support.

TI  - Knowledge-based method for building patient decision-analytic tools.
PG  - 175-9
AB  - Numerous health decision aids (HDAs) have been developed to increase the
      participation of patients in shared decision-making, but many have limited
      accessibility and narrow applicability in clinical care. In the Health
      e-Decision project, we address these limitations in our work on building
      general HDAs targeted for older adults. Our approach uses a
      decision-support software architecture that enables principled methods for
      HDAs. We have formalized a novel knowledge-based decision model (KBDM),
      using Protege OWL, that developers and clinicians can instantiate to
      tailor the components of the architecture for a particular health problem.
      In this paper, we present the methods used in the architecture and the
      knowledgebase design; the latter encompasses influence-diagram concepts,
      specific health problems, health outcome states, and probabilistic
      relationships. We discuss how this approach improves upon prior HDA
      methods. We also show that our use of computer-interpretable knowledge
      provides a structured, customizable means of enabling patient-centered
      decision support.

      computer-interpretable knowledge bases for guideline-based care.
PG  - 784-8
AB  - Developing computer-interpretable clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) to
      provide decision support for guideline-based care is an extremely
      labor-intensive task. In the EON/ATHENA and SAGE projects, we formulated
      substantial portions of CPGs as computable statements that express
      declarative relationships between patient conditions and possible
      interventions. We developed query and expression languages that allow a
      decision-support system (DSS) to evaluate these statements in specific
      patient situations. A DSS can use these guideline statements in multiple
      ways, including: (1) as inputs for determining preferred alternatives in
      decision-making, and (2) as a way to provide targeted commentaries in the
      clinical information system. The use of these declarative statements
      significantly reduces the modeling expertise and effort required to create
      and maintain computer-interpretable knowledge bases for decision-support
      purpose. We discuss possible implications for sharing of such knowledge
      bases.

      problem-based approach.
PG  - 389-93
AB  - As part of a broader project to improve the usability of computerized
      physician order entry (CPOE) systems, we set out to study the cognitive
      tasks physicians undertake to write "admission orders" when admitting a
      patient to the hospital. In particular, we evaluate the hypothesis that
      physicians' mental model of diagnostic and therapeutic planning is problem
      based, whereas both paper-based ordering and CPOE are typically organized
      around functional categories of orders such as those reflected in the
      mnemonic ADCVAANDIML. A task analysis was performed which included
      think-aloud observations of physicians writing orders in clinical care
      settings and for fictional case-scenarios, as well as a semi-structured
      questionnaire. Our work finds core tasks of admitting a patient to
      hospital and conflicts between physicians' mental model and traditional
      ordering systems. Based on our study, we suggest improvements to
      traditional CPOE systems.

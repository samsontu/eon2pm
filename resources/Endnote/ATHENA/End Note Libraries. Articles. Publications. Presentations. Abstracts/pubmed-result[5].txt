TI  - Evaluating provider adherence in a trial of a guideline-based decision
      support system for hypertension.
PG  - 125-9
AB  - Measurement of provider adherence to a guideline-based decision support
      system (DSS) presents a number of important challenges. Establishing a
      causal relationship between the DSS and change in concordance requires
      consideration of both the primary intention of the guideline and different
      ways providers attempt to satisfy the guideline. During our work with a
      guideline-based decision support system for hypertension, ATHENA DSS, we
      document a number of subtle deviations from the strict hypertension
      guideline recommendations that ultimately demonstrate provider adherence.
      We believe that understanding these complexities is crucial to any valid
      evaluation of provider adherence. We also describe the development of an
      advisory evaluation engine that automates the interpretation of clinician
      adherence with the DSS on multiple levels, facilitating the high volume of
      complex data analysis that is created in a clinical trial of a
      guideline-based DSS.

TI  - Translating research into practice: organizational issues in implementing
      automated decision support for hypertension in three medical centers.
PG  - 368-76
AB  - Information technology can support the implementation of clinical research
      findings in practice settings. Technology can address the quality gap in
      health care by providing automated decision support to clinicians that
      integrates guideline knowledge with electronic patient data to present
      real-time, patient-specific recommendations. However, technical success in
      implementing decision support systems may not translate directly into
      system use by clinicians. Successful technology integration into clinical
      work settings requires explicit attention to the organizational context.
      We describe the application of a "sociotechnical" approach to integration
      of ATHENA DSS, a decision support system for the treatment of
      hypertension, into geographically dispersed primary care clinics. We
      applied an iterative technical design in response to organizational input
      and obtained ongoing endorsements of the project by the organization's
      administrative and clinical leadership. Conscious attention to
      organizational context at the time of development, deployment, and
      maintenance of the system was associated with extensive clinician use of
      the system.

TI  - Implementing clinical practice guidelines while taking account of changing
      evidence: ATHENA DSS, an easily modifiable decision-support system for
      managing hypertension in primary care.
PG  - 300-4
AB  - This paper describes the ATHENA Decision Support System (DSS), which
      operationalizes guidelines for hypertension using the EON architecture.
      ATHENA DSS encourages blood pressure control and recommends
      guideline-concordant choice of drug therapy in relation to comorbid
      diseases. ATHENA DSS has an easily modifiable knowledge base that
      specifies eligibility criteria, risk stratification, blood pressure
      targets, relevant comorbid diseases, guideline-recommended drug classes
      for patients with comorbid disease, preferred drugs within each drug
      class, and clinical messages. Because evidence for best management of
      hypertension evolves continually, ATHENA DSS is designed to allow clinical
      experts to customize the knowledge base to incorporate new evidence or to
      reflect local interpretations of guideline ambiguities. Together with its
      database mediator Athenaeum, ATHENA DSS has physical and logical data
      independence from the legacy Computerized Patient Record System (CPRS)
      supplying the patient data, so it can be integrated into a variety of
      electronic medical record systems.

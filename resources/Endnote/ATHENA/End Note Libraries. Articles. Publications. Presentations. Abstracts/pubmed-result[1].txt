TI  - Why don't physicians follow clinical practice guidelines? A framework for
      improvement.
PG  - 1458-65
AB  - CONTEXT: Despite wide promulgation, clinical practice guidelines have had
      limited effect on changing physician behavior. Little is known about the
      process and factors involved in changing physician practices in response
      to guidelines. OBJECTIVE: To review barriers to physician adherence to
      clinical practice guidelines. DATA SOURCES: We searched the MEDLINE,
      Educational Resources Information Center (ERIC), and HealthSTAR databases
      (January 1966 to January 1998); bibliographies; textbooks on health
      behavior or public health; and references supplied by experts to find
      English-language article titles that describe barriers to guideline
      adherence. STUDY SELECTION: Of 5658 articles initially identified, we
      selected 76 published studies describing at least 1 barrier to adherence
      to clinical practice guidelines, practice parameters, clinical policies,
      or national consensus statements. One investigator screened titles to
      identify candidate articles, then 2 investigators independently reviewed
      the texts to exclude articles that did not match the criteria. Differences
      were resolved by consensus with a third investigator. DATA EXTRACTION: Two
      investigators organized barriers to adherence into a framework according
      to their effect on physician knowledge, attitudes, or behavior. This
      organization was validated by 3 additional investigators. DATA SYNTHESIS:
      The 76 articles included 120 different surveys investigating 293 potential
      barriers to physician guideline adherence, including awareness (n = 46),
      familiarity(n = 31), agreement (n = 33), self-efficacy (n = 19), outcome
      expectancy (n = 8), ability to overcome the inertia of previous practice
      (n = 14), and absence of external barriers to perform recommendations (n =
      34). The majority of surveys (70 [58%] of 120) examined only 1 type of
      barrier. CONCLUSIONS: Studies on improving physician guideline adherence
      may not be generalizable, since barriers in one setting may not be present
      in another. Our review offers a differential diagnosis for why physicians
      do not follow practice guidelines, as well as a rational approach toward
      improving guideline adherence and a framework for future research.

TI  - Robustness of a computer-assisted diabetes self-management intervention
      across patient characteristics, healthcare settings, and intervention
      staff.
PG  - 137-45
AB  - BACKGROUND: A major problem in the dissemination of most interventions
      found to be efficacious is that they are of limited or unknown
      generalizability. OBJECTIVE: To document the "robustness," or external
      validity, of a computer-assisted diabetes self-management program across
      different patient characteristics, healthcare settings (mixed payer vs
      health maintenance organization), intervention staff, and outcomes. STUDY
      DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial evaluating a computer-assisted
      behavior change program for adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus
      (n = 217) vs a computerized health risk assessment. METHODS: Outcomes were
      identified using the RE-AIM framework and included program adoption among
      physicians, reach across patient groups, implementation, and behavioral
      (fat intake and physical activity) and biological (glycosylated hemoglobin
      and lipid levels) effectiveness measures. RESULTS: The program achieved
      41% patient participation, variable adoption across healthcare settings
      (76% of health maintenance organization physicians vs 18% of non-health
      maintenance organization physicians participated), good implementation,
      and improvement in behavioral outcomes. There were few significant
      interactions between treatment condition and patient characteristics, type
      of healthcare setting, or interventionist experience on effectiveness
      measures. CONCLUSIONS: Patients and physicians were willing to participate
      in a computer-assisted dietary and physical activity goal-setting
      intervention, although participation varied by healthcare setting.
      Interventionists from different backgrounds successfully delivered the
      intervention, and the results appear robust across various patient and
      delivery characteristics.

TI  - A survey of factors affecting clinician acceptance of clinical decision
      support.
PG  - 6
AB  - BACKGROUND: Real-time clinical decision support (CDS) integrated into
      clinicians' workflow has the potential to profoundly affect the cost,
      quality, and safety of health care delivery. Recent reports have
      identified a surprisingly low acceptance rate for different types of CDS.
      We hypothesized that factors affecting CDS system acceptance could be
      categorized as relating to differences in patients, physicians, CDS-type,
      or environmental characteristics. METHODS: We conducted a survey of all
      adult primary care physicians (PCPs, n = 225) within our group model
      Health Maintenance Organization (HMO) to identify factors that affect
      their acceptance of CDS. We defined clinical decision support broadly as
      "clinical information" that is either provided to you or accessible by
      you, from the clinical workstation (e.g., enhanced flow sheet displays,
      health maintenance reminders, alternative medication suggestions, order
      sets, alerts, and access to any internet-based information resources).
      RESULTS: 110 surveys were returned (49%). There were no differences in the
      age, gender, or years of service between those who returned the survey and
      the entire adult PCP population. Overall, clinicians stated that the CDS
      provided "helps them take better care of their patients" (3.6 on scale of
      1:Never-5:Always), "is worth the time it takes" (3.5), and "reminds them
      of something they've forgotten" (3.2). There was no difference in the
      perceived acceptance rate of alerts based on their type (i.e., cost,
      safety, health maintenance). When asked about specific patient
      characteristics that would make the clinicians "more", "equally" or "less"
      likely to accept alerts: 41% stated that they were more (8% stated "less")
      likely to accept alerts on elderly patients (> 65 yrs); 38% were more (14%
      stated less) likely to accept alerts on patients with more than 5 current
      medications; and 38% were more (20% stated less) likely to accept alerts
      on patients with more than 5 chronic clinical conditions. Interestingly,
      80% said they were less likely to accept alerts when they were behind
      schedule and 84% of clinicians admitted to being at least 20 minutes
      behind schedule "some", "most", or "all of the time". CONCLUSION: Even
      though a majority of our clinical decision support suggestions are not
      explicitly followed, clinicians feel they are of benefit and would be even
      more beneficial if they had more time available to address them.

PG  - 334-8
AB  - There is very little known about the limits of alerting in the setting of
      the outpatient Electronic Medical Record (EMR). We are interested in how
      users value and prefer such alerts. One hundred Kaiser Permanente primary
      care clinicians were sent a four-page questionnaire. It contained
      questions related to the usability and usefulness of different approaches
      to presenting reminder and alert information. The survey also contained
      questions about the desirability of six categories of alerts. Forty-three
      of 100 questionnaires were returned. Users generally preferred an active,
      more intrusive interaction model for "alerts" and a passive, less
      intrusive model for order messages and other types of reminders and
      notifications. Drug related alerts were more highly rated than health
      maintenance or disease state reminders. Users indicated that more alerts
      would make the system "more useful" but "less easy to use".

TI  - Improving blood pressure control through provider education, provider
      alerts, and patient education: a cluster randomized trial.
PG  - 165-75
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inadequate blood pressure control is a persistent gap in
      quality care. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate provider and patient interventions to
      improve blood pressure control. DESIGN: Cluster randomized, controlled
      trial. SETTING: 2 hospital-based and 8 community-based clinics in the
      Veterans Affairs Tennessee Valley Healthcare System. PATIENTS: 1341
      veterans with essential hypertension cared for by 182 providers. Eligible
      patients had 2 or more blood pressure measurements greater than 140/90 mm
      Hg in a 6-month period and were taking a single antihypertensive agent.
      INTERVENTION: Providers who cared for eligible patients were randomly
      assigned to receive an e-mail with a Web-based link to the Seventh Report
      of the Joint National Committee on the Prevention, Detection, Evaluation
      and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC 7) guidelines (provider
      education); provider education and a patient-specific hypertension
      computerized alert (provider education and alert); or provider education,
      hypertension alert, and patient education, in which patients were sent a
      letter advocating drug adherence, lifestyle modification, and
      conversations with providers (patient education). MEASUREMENTS: Proportion
      of patients with a systolic blood pressure less than 140 mm Hg at 6
      months; intensification of antihypertensive medication. RESULTS: Mean
      baseline blood pressure was 157/83 mm Hg with no differences between
      groups (P = 0.105). Six-month follow-up data were available for 975
      patients (73%). Patients of providers who were randomly assigned to the
      patient education group had better blood pressure control (138/75 mm Hg)
      than those in the provider education and alert or provider education alone
      groups (146/76 mm Hg and 145/78 mm Hg, respectively). More patients in the
      patient education group had a systolic blood pressure of 140 mm Hg or less
      compared with those in the provider education or provider education and
      alert groups (adjusted relative risk for the patient education group
      compared with the provider education alone group, 1.31 [95% CI, 1.06 to
      1.62]; P = 0.012). LIMITATIONS: Follow-up blood pressure measurements were
      missing for 27% of study patients. The study could not detect a mechanism
      by which patient education improved blood pressure control. CONCLUSIONS: A
      multifactorial intervention including patient education improved blood
      pressure control compared with provider education alone.

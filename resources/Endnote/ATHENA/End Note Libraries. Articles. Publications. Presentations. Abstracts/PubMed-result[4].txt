TI  - Clinician awareness of adherence to hypertension guidelines.
PG  - 747-54
AB  - PURPOSE: Little is known about how well clinicians are aware of their own
      adherence to clinical guidelines, an important indicator of quality. We
      compared clinicians' beliefs about their adherence to hypertension
      guidelines with data on their actual performance. METHODS: We surveyed 139
      primary care clinicians at three Veterans Affairs medical centers, asking
      them to assess their own adherence to hypertension guidelines. We then
      extracted data from the centers' clinical databases on
      guideline-concordant medication use and blood pressure control for
      patients cared for by these providers during a 6-month period. Data were
      collected for patients with hypertension and diabetes, hypertension and
      coronary disease, or hypertension with neither of these comorbid
      conditions. RESULTS: Eighty-six clinicians (62%) completed the survey.
      Each clinician saw a median of 94 patients with hypertension (mean age, 65
      years). Patients were treated with an average of 1.6 antihypertensive
      medications. Overall, clinicians overestimated the proportion of their
      patients who were prescribed guideline-concordant medications (75%
      perceived vs. 67% actual, P <0.001) and who had blood pressure levels
      <140/90 mm Hg on their last visit (68% perceived vs. 43% actual, P
      <0.001). Among individual clinicians, there were no significant
      correlations between perceived and actual guideline adherence (r = 0.18
      for medications, r = 0.14 for blood pressure control; P > or =0.10 for
      both). Clinicians with relatively low actual guideline performance were
      most likely to overestimate their adherence to medication recommendations
      and blood pressure targets. CONCLUSION: Clinicians appear to overestimate
      their adherence to hypertension guidelines, particularly with regards to
      the proportion of their patients with controlled blood pressure. This
      limited awareness may represent a barrier to successful implementation of
      guidelines, and could be addressed through the use of provider profiles
      and point-of-service feedback to clinicians.

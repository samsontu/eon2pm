TI  - Unskilled and unaware of it: how difficulties in recognizing one's own
      incompetence lead to inflated self-assessments.
PG  - 1121-34
AB  - People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many
      social and intellectual domains. The authors suggest that this
      overestimation occurs, in part, because people who are unskilled in these
      domains suffer a dual burden: Not only do these people reach erroneous
      conclusions and make unfortunate choices, but their incompetence robs them
      of the metacognitive ability to realize it. Across 4 studies, the authors
      found that participants scoring in the bottom quartile on tests of humor,
      grammar, and logic grossly overestimated their test performance and
      ability. Although their test scores put them in the 12th percentile, they
      estimated themselves to be in the 62nd. Several analyses linked this
      miscalibration to deficits in metacognitive skill, or the capacity to
      distinguish accuracy from error. Paradoxically, improving the skills of
      participants, and thus increasing their metacognitive competence, helped
      them recognize the limitations of their abilities.

TI  - Feeling "holier than thou": are self-serving assessments produced by
      errors in self- or social prediction?
PG  - 861-75
AB  - People typically believe they are more likely to engage in selfless, kind,
      and generous behaviors than their peers, a result that is both logically
      and statistically suspect. However, this oft-documented tendency presents
      an important ambiguity. Do people feel "holier than thou" because they
      harbor overly cynical views of their peers (but accurate impressions of
      themselves) or overly charitable views of themselves (and accurate
      impressions of their peers)? Four studies suggested it was the latter.
      Participants consistently overestimated the likelihood that they would act
      in generous or selfless ways, whereas their predictions of others were
      considerably more accurate. Two final studies suggest this divergence in
      accuracy arises, in part, because people are unwilling to consult
      population base rates when predicting their own behavior but use this
      diagnostic information more readily when predicting others'.

TI  - How chronic self-views influence (and potentially mislead) estimates of
      performance.
PG  - 5-17
AB  - An important source of people's perceptions of their performance, and
      potential errors in those perceptions, are chronic views people hold
      regarding their abilities. In support of this observation, manipulating
      people's general views of their ability, or altering which view seemed
      most relevant to a task, changed performance estimates independently of
      any impact on actual performance. A final study extended this analysis to
      why women disproportionately avoid careers in science. Women performed
      equally to men on a science quiz, yet underestimated their performance
      because they thought less of their general scientific reasoning ability
      than did men. They, consequently, were more likely to refuse to enter a
      science competition.

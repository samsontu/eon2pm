      adherence.
PG  - 915
AB  - Studies of barriers to guideline adherence have generally surveyed
      clinicians temporally remote from the clinical scenario in which
      recommendations were delivered, potentially adversely biasing clinician
      observations. The user interface of ATHENA DSS, a guideline-based decision
      support system for hypertension, includes a point-of-care feedback window
      that accepts clinician-user comments during the display of
      recommendations. Analysis of this feedback has revealed a number of
      intriguing patient, provider, and technical barriers to adherence
      collected during real-time system use.

TI  - Physicians' Internet information-seeking behaviors.
PG  - 31-8
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Our understanding about the role of the Internet as a
      resource for physicians has improved in the past several years with
      reports of patterns for use and measures of impact on medical practice.
      The purpose of this study was to begin to shape a theory base for more
      fully describing physicians' information-seeking behaviors as they apply
      to Internet use and applications for continuing education providers to
      more effectively support learning. METHODS: A survey about Internet use
      and physician information seeking was administered by facsimile
      transmission to a random sample of 3,347 physicians. RESULTS: Almost all
      physicians have access to the Internet, and most believe it is important
      for patient care. The most frequent use is in accessing the latest
      research on specific topics, new information in a disease area, and
      information related to a specific patient problem. Critical to seeking
      clinical information is the credibility of the source, followed by
      relevance, unlimited access, speed, and ease of use. Electronic media are
      viewed as increasingly important sources for clinical information, with
      decreased use of journals and local continuing medical education (CME).
      Barriers to finding needed information include too much information, lack
      of specific information, and navigation or searching difficulties.
      DISCUSSION: The Internet has become an important force in how physicians
      deliver care. Understanding more about physician information-seeking
      needs, behaviors, and uses is critical to CME providers to support a
      self-directed curriculum for each physician. A shift to increased use of
      electronic CME options points to new demands for users and providers.
      Specific information about how physicians create a question and search for
      resources is an area that requires providers to develop new skills.

TI  - Computer use among community-based primary care physician preceptors.
PG  - 580-90
AB  - PURPOSE: Use of the Internet to access biomedical information in patient
      care has important implications in medical education. Little is known
      about how community-based clinical teachers use computers in their offices
      and what factors, such as age, may influence use. METHOD: A total of 178
      active community-based primary care preceptors were mailed a 15-item
      questionnaire about their computer equipment; Internet use; and specific
      applications in patient care, patients' education, medical students' or
      residents' education, or accessing other clinical and/or research
      information. Data analysis used descriptive statistics, chi-square for
      comparisons of categorical data and analysis of variance (ANOVA) mixed
      model for comparisons of continuous variables. All tests were two-tailed
      with alpha set at.05 to determine statistical significance. RESULTS: In
      all, 129 preceptors responded (73%). Office computer availability was high
      (92%). The Internet as a clinical information resource was used most
      frequently (98%) and MD Consult and Medline-EBM were used less frequently
      (20% and 21%, respectively). No statistical differences were found in
      routine use by age of preceptor; frequency of use did differ. Preceptors
      60 years or older were four times more likely to use the Internet to
      assist in students' and residents' education (p =.02) and at least twice
      as likely to use full text Medline articles for patient care decisions (p
      =.05) than their younger colleagues. Decreased computer use was related to
      lack of time (45%) or other logistical reasons (40%), such as the
      computer's distance from the patient care areas or slow connections.
      CONCLUSIONS: Rates of computer access and Internet connectivity were high
      among community-based preceptors of all ages. Uses of specific online
      clinical and/or educational resources varied by preceptors' age with more
      rather than less use among older preceptors, an unexpected finding.

TI  - Assessment of internet use and effects among healthcare professionals: a
      cross sectional survey.
PG  - 274-9
AB  - PURPOSE: Several studies have explored the scientific platforms on patient
      use of the internet for health information. In contrast physicians'
      perspective on evolving internet environment is lacking. The purpose of
      this study is to assess and correlate the extent of internet use among
      healthcare professionals and examine its effects on clinical practice.
      METHODS: Cross sectional survey conducted in the USA using questionnaires
      distributed randomly to healthcare professionals attending distinct
      continuing medical education programmes between 2003 and 2004. Multiple
      choice and yes/no questions related to the trends of internet use and its
      effects on clinical practice were extracted and responses analysed. The
      main outcome measures are self reported rates of internet use, perceived
      effects, and the role of medical web sites in clinical practice. RESULTS:
      The overall response rate was 60%. A total of 277 survey respondents (97%)
      had internet access. Some 7% in private practice and 1% of group practice
      physicians did not have internet access. Most (71%) used the internet
      regularly for medical or professional updating and 62% (n = 178) felt the
      need for sharing web sites designed for healthcare professionals with
      patients. Some 27% of the physicians currently own established personal
      practice web sites. Sixty three per cent have recommended a web site to a
      patient for more information, matching the positive trust (>70%) on the
      general quality of selected medical web sites. CONCLUSION: This cross
      sectional survey shows that internet use and web based medical information
      is widely popular among physicians and patients. About 23%-31% of the
      healthcare professionals report >80% interaction with web informed
      patients in their daily practice.

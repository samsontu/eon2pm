TI  - Academic detailing to improve antihypertensive prescribing patterns.
PG  - 508-11
AB  - Several studies indicate that treatment of hypertension in the United
      States does not follow recommendations from expert bodies. We thus
      implemented a program using academic detailers to increase practitioner
      compliance with antihypertensive treatment guidelines. Five Veterans
      Affairs medical facilities including academic medical centers and
      community based outpatient clinics were chosen for the intervention.
      Pharmacists were trained as academic detailers, and the intervention
      included lectures, educational materials, provider profiling, and meetings
      with 25 to 50 providers each. After intervention, the proportion of
      hypertensives receiving calcium antagonists decreased from 43% to 38% (P
      <.001), whereas the proportion receiving a beta blocker or thiazide
      diuretic increased from 58% to 64% (P <.001). For hypertensive subjects
      with diabetes mellitus or congestive heart failure, the proportion
      receiving an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin
      receptor blocker increased from 72% to 76% for the former and from 74% to
      78% for the latter (P <.001 for both). Among hypertensive subjects with
      coronary artery disease an increase in beta blocker use was noted after
      intervention (P <.001 for change from baseline). Prescribing patterns
      after academic detailing more closely followed national recommendations.

TI  - Accuracy of computerized outpatient diagnoses in a Veterans Affairs
      general medicine clinic.
PG  - 37-43
AB  - BACKGROUND: Electronically available data, both administrative, such as
      outpatient encounter diagnostic data, and clinical, such as problem lists,
      are being used increasingly for outcome and quality assessment, risk
      adjustment, and clinical reminder systems. OBJECTIVE: To determine the
      accuracy of outpatient primary care diagnostic information recorded in
      administrative and clinical files in a Veterans Affairs VISTA (Veterans
      Health Information Systems and Technology Architecture) database compared
      with medical chart notes. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional medical chart
      review of 148 patients attending a general medicine clinic at a
      university-affiliated Veterans Affairs hospital for 9 diagnoses relevant
      to the choice of drug therapy for hypertension. PATIENTS AND METHODS: An
      administrative file of encounter diagnoses, for a 2-year period, and a
      clinical file of the problem list maintained by the clinician were the
      sources of electronic diagnoses. We compared these sources with diagnoses
      abstracted by medical chart review. We estimated the sensitivity and
      specificity of each electronic data source for detecting medical chart
      note diagnoses. RESULTS: The sensitivity for 8 of the 9 study diagnoses
      was greater than 80% in the administrative file and 49% in the clinical
      problem list. The specificity was good for the administrative file (91% to
      100%) and even better for the clinical file (98% to 100%). CONCLUSIONS:
      Outpatient encounter diagnoses relevant to hypertension recorded as
      electronic data had high specificity, and some codes had high sensitivity
      when collected over multiple visits. The administrative file was more
      sensitive but less specific than the clinical file. Administrative vs
      clinical files can be selected to minimize either the false-negative or
      the false-positive designations, respectively, as dictated by the needs of
      the quality assessment review.

AB  - We present a methodology and database mediator tool for integrating modern
      knowledge-based systems, such as the Stanford EON architecture for
      automated guideline-based decision-support, with legacy databases, such as
      the Veterans Health Information Systems & Technology Architecture (VISTA)
      systems, which are used nation-wide. Specifically, we discuss designs for
      database integration in ATHENA, a system for hypertension care based on
      EON, at the VA Palo Alto Health Care System. We describe a new database
      mediator that affords the EON system both physical and logical data
      independence from the legacy VA database. We found that to achieve our
      design goals, the mediator requires two separate mapping levels and must
      itself involve a knowledge-based component.

      system.
PG  - 538-42
AB  - ATHENA DSS is a decision-support system that provides recommendations for
      managing hypertension in primary care. ATHENA DSS is built on a
      component-based architecture called EON. User acceptance of a system like
      this one depends partly on how well the system explains its reasoning and
      justifies its conclusions. We addressed this issue by adapting WOZ, a
      declarative explanation framework, to build an explanation function for
      ATHENA DSS. ATHENA DSS is built based on a component-based architecture
      called EON. The explanation function obtains its information by tapping
      into EON's components, as well as into other relevant sources such as the
      guideline document and medical literature. It uses an argument model to
      identify the pieces of information that constitute an explanation, and
      employs a set of visual clients to display that explanation. By
      incorporating varied information sources, by mirroring naturally occurring
      medical arguments and by utilizing graphic visualizations, ATHENA DSS's
      explanation function generates rich, evidence-based explanations.

      support system for hypertension.
PG  - 125-9
AB  - Measurement of provider adherence to a guideline-based decision support
      system (DSS) presents a number of important challenges. Establishing a
      causal relationship between the DSS and change in concordance requires
      consideration of both the primary intention of the guideline and different
      ways providers attempt to satisfy the guideline. During our work with a
      guideline-based decision support system for hypertension, ATHENA DSS, we
      document a number of subtle deviations from the strict hypertension
      guideline recommendations that ultimately demonstrate provider adherence.
      We believe that understanding these complexities is crucial to any valid
      evaluation of provider adherence. We also describe the development of an
      advisory evaluation engine that automates the interpretation of clinician
      adherence with the DSS on multiple levels, facilitating the high volume of
      complex data analysis that is created in a clinical trial of a
      guideline-based DSS.

TI  - Clinician awareness of adherence to hypertension guidelines.
PG  - 747-54
AB  - PURPOSE: Little is known about how well clinicians are aware of their own
      adherence to clinical guidelines, an important indicator of quality. We
      compared clinicians' beliefs about their adherence to hypertension
      guidelines with data on their actual performance. METHODS: We surveyed 139
      primary care clinicians at three Veterans Affairs medical centers, asking
      them to assess their own adherence to hypertension guidelines. We then
      extracted data from the centers' clinical databases on
      guideline-concordant medication use and blood pressure control for
      patients cared for by these providers during a 6-month period. Data were
      collected for patients with hypertension and diabetes, hypertension and
      coronary disease, or hypertension with neither of these comorbid
      conditions. RESULTS: Eighty-six clinicians (62%) completed the survey.
      Each clinician saw a median of 94 patients with hypertension (mean age, 65
      years). Patients were treated with an average of 1.6 antihypertensive
      medications. Overall, clinicians overestimated the proportion of their
      patients who were prescribed guideline-concordant medications (75%
      perceived vs. 67% actual, P <0.001) and who had blood pressure levels
      <140/90 mm Hg on their last visit (68% perceived vs. 43% actual, P
      <0.001). Among individual clinicians, there were no significant
      correlations between perceived and actual guideline adherence (r = 0.18
      for medications, r = 0.14 for blood pressure control; P > or =0.10 for
      both). Clinicians with relatively low actual guideline performance were
      most likely to overestimate their adherence to medication recommendations
      and blood pressure targets. CONCLUSION: Clinicians appear to overestimate
      their adherence to hypertension guidelines, particularly with regards to
      the proportion of their patients with controlled blood pressure. This
      limited awareness may represent a barrier to successful implementation of
      guidelines, and could be addressed through the use of provider profiles
      and point-of-service feedback to clinicians.

PG  - 1003-7
AB  - We develop a method and algorithm for deciding the optimal approach to
      creating quality-auditing protocols for guideline-based clinical
      performance measures. An important element of the audit protocol design
      problem is deciding which guide-line elements to audit. Specifically, the
      problem is how and when to aggregate individual patient case-specific
      guideline elements into population-based quality measures. The key
      statistical issue involved is the trade-off between increased reliability
      with more general population-based quality measures versus increased
      validity from individually case-adjusted but more restricted measures done
      at a greater audit cost. Our intelligent algorithm for auditing protocol
      design is based on hierarchically modeling incrementally case-adjusted
      quality constraints. We select quality constraints to measure using an
      optimization criterion based on statistical generalizability coefficients.
      We present results of the approach from a deployed decision support system
      for a hypertension guideline.

PG  - 11-5
AB  - Automated quality assessment of clinician actions and patient outcomes is
      a central problem in guideline- or standards-based medical care. In this
      paper we describe a model representation and algorithm for deriving
      structured quality indicators and auditing protocols from formalized
      specifications of guidelines used in decision support systems. We apply
      the model and algorithm to the assessment of physician concordance with a
      guideline knowledge model for hypertension used in a decision-support
      system. The properties of our solution include the ability to derive
      automatically context-specific and case-mix-adjusted quality indicators
      that can model global or local levels of detail about the guideline
      parameterized by defining the reliability of each indicator or element of
      the guideline.

TI  - Implementing clinical practice guidelines while taking account of changing
      evidence: ATHENA DSS, an easily modifiable decision-support system for
      managing hypertension in primary care.
PG  - 300-4
AB  - This paper describes the ATHENA Decision Support System (DSS), which
      operationalizes guidelines for hypertension using the EON architecture.
      ATHENA DSS encourages blood pressure control and recommends
      guideline-concordant choice of drug therapy in relation to comorbid
      diseases. ATHENA DSS has an easily modifiable knowledge base that
      specifies eligibility criteria, risk stratification, blood pressure
      targets, relevant comorbid diseases, guideline-recommended drug classes
      for patients with comorbid disease, preferred drugs within each drug
      class, and clinical messages. Because evidence for best management of
      hypertension evolves continually, ATHENA DSS is designed to allow clinical
      experts to customize the knowledge base to incorporate new evidence or to
      reflect local interpretations of guideline ambiguities. Together with its
      database mediator Athenaeum, ATHENA DSS has physical and logical data

TI  - Improving adherence to guidelines for hypertension drug prescribing:
      cluster-randomized controlled trial of general versus patient-specific
      recommendations.
PG  - 677-85
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether an intervention focusing clinician
      attention on drug choice for hypertension treatment improves concordance
      between drug regimens and guidelines. STUDY DESIGN: Cluster-randomized
      controlled trial comparing an individualized intervention with a general
      guideline implementation in geographically diverse primary care clinics of
      a university-affiliated Department of Veterans Affairs healthcare system.
      METHODS: Participants were 36 attending physicians and nurse practitioners
      (16 in the general group and 20 in the individualized group), with
      findings based on 4500 hypertensive patients. A general guideline
      implementation for all clinicians, including education about
      guideline-based drug recommendations and goals for adequacy of blood
      pressure control, was compared with addition of a printed individualized
      advisory sent to clinicians at each patient visit, indicating whether or
      not the patient's antihypertensive drug regimen was guideline concordant.
      We measured change from baseline to end point in the proportion of
      clinicians' patients whose drug therapy was guideline concordant. RESULTS:
      The individualized intervention resulted in an improvement in guideline
      concordance more than twice that observed for the general intervention
      (10.9% vs 3.8%, t = 2.796, P = .008). Bootstrap analysis showed that being
      in the individualized group increased the odds of concordance 1.5-fold (P
      = .025). The proportion of patients with adequate blood pressure control
      increased within each study group; however, the difference between groups
      was not significant. CONCLUSION: An individualized advisory regarding drug
      therapy for hypertension given to the clinician at each patient visit was
      more effective in changing clinician prescribing behavior than
      implementation of a general guideline.

PG  - 617-21
AB  - Numerous approaches have been proposed to integrate the text of guideline
      documents with guideline-based care systems. Current approaches range from
      serving marked up guideline text documents to generating advisories using
      complex guideline knowledge bases. These approaches have integration
      problems mainly because they tend to rigidly link the knowledge base with
      text. We are developing a bridge approach that uses an information
      retrieval technology. The new approach facilitates a versatile
      decision-support system by using flexible links between the formal
      structures of the knowledge base and the natural language style of the
      guideline text.

TI  - Modeling guidelines for integration into clinical workflow.
PG  - 174-8
AB  - The success of clinical decision-support systems requires that they are
      seamlessly integrated into clinical workflow. In the SAGE project, which
      aims to create the technological infra-structure for implementing
      computable clinical practice guide-lines in enterprise settings, we
      created a deployment-driven methodology for developing guideline knowledge
      bases. It involves (1) identification of usage scenarios of
      guideline-based care in clinical workflow, (2) distillation and
      disambiguation of guideline knowledge relevant to these usage scenarios,
      (3) formalization of data elements and vocabulary used in the guideline,
      and (4) encoding of usage scenarios and guideline knowledge using an
      executable guideline model. This methodology makes explicit the points in
      the care process where guideline-based decision aids are appropriate and
      the roles of clinicians for whom the guideline-based assistance is
      intended. We have evaluated the methodology by simulating the deployment
      of an immunization guideline in a real clinical information system and by
      reconstructing the workflow context of a deployed decision-support system
      for guideline-based care. We discuss the implication of deployment-driven
      guideline encoding for sharability of executable guidelines.

TI  - Translating research into practice: organizational issues in implementing
      automated decision support for hypertension in three medical centers.
PG  - 368-76
AB  - Information technology can support the implementation of clinical research
      findings in practice settings. Technology can address the quality gap in
      health care by providing automated decision support to clinicians that
      integrates guideline knowledge with electronic patient data to present
      real-time, patient-specific recommendations. However, technical success in
      implementing decision support systems may not translate directly into
      system use by clinicians. Successful technology integration into clinical
      work settings requires explicit attention to the organizational context.
      We describe the application of a "sociotechnical" approach to integration
      of ATHENA DSS, a decision support system for the treatment of
      hypertension, into geographically dispersed primary care clinics. We
      applied an iterative technical design in response to organizational input
      and obtained ongoing endorsements of the project by the organization's
      administrative and clinical leadership. Conscious attention to
      organizational context at the time of development, deployment, and
      maintenance of the system was associated with extensive clinician use of
      the system.

TI  - Patient safety in guideline-based decision support for hypertension
      management: ATHENA DSS.
PG  - 214-8
AB  - The Institute of Medicine recently issued a landmark report on medical
      error.1 In the penumbra of this report, every aspect of health care is
      subject to new scrutiny regarding patient safety. Informatics technology
      can support patient safety by correcting problems inherent in older
      technology; however, new information technology can also contribute to new
      sources of error. We report here a categorization of possible errors that
      may arise in deploying a system designed to give guideline-based advice on
      prescribing drugs, an approach to anticipating these errors in an
      automated guideline system, and design features to minimize errors and
      thereby maximize patient safety. Our guideline implementation system,
      based on the EON architecture, provides a framework for a knowledge base
      that is sufficiently comprehensive to incorporate safety information, and
      that is easily reviewed and updated by clinician-experts.

      factors.
PG  - 70.e9-15
AB  - PURPOSE: Poor blood pressure control remains a common problem that
      contributes to significant cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,
      particularly among African Americans. We explored antihypertensive
      medication adherence and other factors that may explain racial differences
      in blood pressure control. METHODS: Baseline data were obtained from the
      Veteran's Study to Improve The Control of Hypertension, a randomized
      controlled trial designed to improve blood pressure control. Clinical,
      demographic, and psychosocial factors relating to blood pressure control
      were examined. RESULTS: A total of 569 patients who were African American
      (41%) or white (59%) were enrolled in the study. African Americans were
      more likely to have inadequate baseline blood pressure control than whites
      (63% vs 50%; odds ratio = 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.20-2.41).
      Among 20 factors related to blood pressure control, African Americans also
      had a higher odds ratio of being nonadherent to their medication, being
      more functionally illiterate, and having a family member with hypertension
      compared with whites. Compared with whites, African Americans also were
      more likely to perceive high blood pressure as serious and to experience
      the side effect of increased urination compared with whites. Adjusting for
      these differences reduced the odds ratio of African Americans having
      adequate blood pressure control to 1.59 (95% confidence interval
      1.09-2.29). CONCLUSIONS: In this sample of hypertensive patients who have
      good access to health care and medication benefits, African Americans
      continued to have lower levels of blood pressure control despite
      considering more than 20 factors related to blood pressure control.
      Interventions designed to improve medication adherence need to take race
      into account. Patients' self-reports of failure to take medications
      provide an opportunity for clinicians to explore reasons for medication
      nonadherence, thereby improving adherence and potentially blood pressure
      control.

TI  - The veterans' study to improve the control of hypertension (V-STITCH):
      design and methodology.
PG  - 155-68
AB  - BACKGROUND: Among the 60 million Americans with hypertension, only
      approximately 31% have their blood pressure (BP) under control (<140/90 mm
      Hg). Despite the damaging impact of hypertension and the availability of
      evidence-based target values for BP, interventions to improve BP control
      have had limited success. OBJECTIVES: A randomized controlled health
      services intervention trial with a split-plot design is being conducted to
      improve BP control. This 4-year trial evaluates both a patient and a
      provider intervention in a primary care setting among diagnosed
      hypertensive veterans. METHODS: In a cluster-randomization, 30 primary
      care providers in the Durham VAMC Primary Care Clinic were randomly
      assigned to receive the provider intervention or control. The provider
      intervention is a patient-specific electronically generated hypertension
      decision support system (DSS) delivering guideline-based recommendations
      to the provider at each patient's visit, designed to improve
      guideline-concordant therapy. For these providers, a sample of their
      hypertensive patients (n=588) was randomly assigned to receive a
      telephone-administered patient intervention or usual care. The patient
      intervention incorporates patients' need assessments and involves tailored
      behavioral and education modules to promote medication adherence and
      improve specific health behaviors. All modules are delivered over the
      telephone bi-monthly for 24 months. In this trial, the primary outcome is
      the proportion of patients who achieve a BP < or =140/90 mm Hg at each
      outpatient clinic visit over 24 months. CONCLUSION: Despite the known risk
      of poor BP control, a majority of adults still do not have their BP
      controlled. This study is an important step in testing the effectiveness
      of a patient and provider intervention to improve BP control among
      veterans in the primary care setting.

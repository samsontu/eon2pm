However, care may be considered futile according to several definitions of that word, including that which describes futile treatment as something that does not benefit the patient as a whole. Furthermore, care may be considered unreasonable if it is excessive and not generally agreed upon. Physician refusal to provide futile or unreasonable care is supported by the ethical principles of nonmaleficence, beneficence, and distributive justice. The last principle is particularly relevant in the current climate of healthcare reform.</p>

Physicians are not ethically required to provide futile or unreasonable care, especially to patients who are brain dead, vegetative, critically or terminally ill with little chance of recovery, and unlikely to benefit from cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p>

</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="21"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">Medical ethics is a set of moral principles that govern the behavior of physicians and other health professionals. As discussed by Beauchamp and Childress <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#87">[1]</a>, one principle of medical ethics is autonomy: respect for the patient's capacity of self-determination and exercise of personal, informed choice. Another is nonmaleficence: the obligation not to inflict harm intentionally. A third principle is beneficence: the provision of benefit, which generally is defined as something that promotes well-being. A fourth is distributive justice: the fair, equitable, and appropriate distribution of medical resources in society.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="22"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">These four ethical principles have evolved over time and are not immutable. Nevertheless, they provide a moral framework for making medical decisions, including those decisions that involve the administration of life-sustaining therapies <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#88">[2,3]</a>. Historically, such decisions were made by physicians operating under the principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence. These principles allowed physicians to do what they considered best for patients, including not providing care for persons who were "overmastered by their diseases,'' in the words of Hippocrates <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#90">[4]</a>. This stance was in keeping with the fact that physicians could offer few beneficial therapies to the critically ill.</p>

</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="24"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">Increasingly in the United States, medical decisions have been made by patients and their surrogates under the principle of autonomy. One reason for this shift is that more potentially beneficial therapies are now available, and patients and surrogates, especially those individuals with third-party coverage, expect access to them. Another reason is that physicians have encouraged patients' and surrogates' expectations. Fee-forservice reimbursement has reinforced this encouragement on the part of physicians, who generally have profited from the care they deliver. Nevertheless, it has been prompted primarily by the physicians' deep sense of obligation to the patients for whom they care.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="25"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">This sense of obligation is captured in what might be called the "single master'' view of medicine. As articulated by Levinsky <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#91">[5]</a>, this view holds that physicians should not be providers and rationers of medical services simultaneously. Instead, they "... are required to do everything that they believe may benefit each patient without regard to costs or other social considerations. In caring for an individual patient, the doctor must act solely as that patient's advocate, against the apparent interests of society as a whole, if necessary.'' The single master view has been very compelling to physicians in the United States. It has influenced them to provide many kinds of care, including that which may be considered futile, either voluntarily or in response to patient and surrogate demands.</p>

</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="27"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">The English word "futile'' was derived from the Latin root futilis, meaning that which easily pours or melts. This root, in turn, stemmed from a Greek myth in which the daughters of the King of Argos, who murdered their husbands on the instructions of their father, were condemned by the gods to collect water for eternity using leaky sieves. From this story has come the concept that futile acts, including certain medical interventions, are ineffective and incapable of achieving a desired result or goal.</p>

One kind of goal is physiologic, for example, the raising of blood pressure by vasoactive agents. Another is post-poning death by the administration of antibiotics or other means. A third goal is lengthening life for some period, such as by the use of mechanical ventilation. A fourth goal is improving the quality of life, so that the patient whose life is prolonged can also live independently. Presumably, an intervention could be deemed futile if it failed to meet one or all of these goals.</p>

They have proposed that a treatment should be considered futile if it has been useless in the last 100 cases of a physician's personal experience or in published reports. A treatment that merely preserves permanent unconsciousness or cannot end dependence on critical care should also be considered futile. Furthermore, "in judging futility, physicians must distinguish between an effect, which is limited to a part of the patient's body, and a benefit, which appreciably improves the person as a whole.''</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="31"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">In recent years, a number of prognostic scoring systems have been developed to assist physicians in determining which patients are most likely to benefit from life-sustaining treatment. These systems, which include the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) system, use large databases to predict the hospital mortality of patients who receive critical care. Depending on the decision criteria used, the systems have a positive predictive value of approximate 80%, and a negative predictive value of approximate 90%. These values correlate well with clinical judgment in most series.</p>

</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="33"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">The use of prognostic scoring systems such as APACHE in deciding who is likely to benefit from life-sustaining treatment is ethically appropriate because the systems are as reliable as clinical judgment <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#94">[8]</a>. Nevertheless, using the systems specifically for limiting care was not intended by their developers, and the systems only analyze hospital mortality, not the duration or quality of life after discharge. Furthermore, physicians who use the systems must realize that there is always some chance that an individual patient will survive despite a high likelihood of hospital mortality. The 95% confidence intervals for the mortality of 100 patients are 97 to 100.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="34"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">In addition to the fact that outcome cannot be perfectly predicted, the concept of futility is limited in that physicians, patients, surrogates, and other parties may view futility differently. For example, some patients or their surrogates would settle for extended biological life as a result of treatment, whereas Schneiderman et al. <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#93">[7]</a> would consider treatment futile if it could not end permanent unconsciousness or dependence on critical care. Furthermore, as noted by Truog et al. <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#95">[9]</a>, arguments based on the concept of futility often contain implicit concerns of resource allocation that might be better addressed if the concerns were made explicitly.</p>

</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="36"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">Given these and other limitations, the concept of futility should probably be restricted to the original connotation of futilis in describing acts that are ineffective and incapable of producing a desired result. Those people who prefer a very limited use of the concept may limit it to the idea of physiologic futility proposed by Younger <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#92">[6]</a>, although this use does not allow for describing benefit as "that which appreciably improves the patient as a whole,'' as advocated by Schneiderman et al <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#93">[7]</a>. If the word "futile'' is used to convey a meaning such as the limited likelihood of prolonging life or improving its quality, this meaning should be spelled out, and some quantitative notion of the likelihood (not necessarily zero) should be used. Alternatively, futility should be replaced or augmented by another word that provides a concept that is applicable in more circumstances.</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="37"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">One word that might replace or augment "futile'' is "reasonable,'' meaning rational, not excessive, and generally agreed upon. The concept of reasonableness can be applied both to medical interventions and to the benefits sought by such interventions. Reasonableness allows for more latitude than futility in that interventions considered unreasonable need not always be ineffective, and benefits considered unreasonable need not be incapable of being achieved. In this regard, Jonsen <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#96">[10]</a> noted that "... The old tutorist rule requires a physician to supply a procedure that offers any chance of saving life. A more relaxed rule would allow the selection of a level of probability or a reasonable chance. It would remove from the moral vocabulary of medicine the phrase `Do everything' and substitute `Do as much as is reasonable.'''</p>

</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="39"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">Although the concept of reasonableness allows for more latitude than futility does, people still may define what is reasonable differently. Ultimately then, the key issue with both futility and reasonableness is not so much the definitions of the words, but rather, whose definitions are accepted. Physicians are allowed to define physiologic futility entirely because they possess the requisite scientific knowledge. Tomlinson and Brody <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#97">[11]</a> also have argued that only physicians can decide what constitutes reasonable medical practice. This decision-making is appropriate because physicians have "the moral authority to judge not just the harms, but also the benefits of medical interventions. This authority flows from the social concern with their professional rather than their personal or individual integrity.''</p>
</td><td class="fulltext-body-graphics">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td class="fulltext-body-paragraph"><a name="40"></a><p class="fulltext-TEXT fulltext-INDENT">The essence of Tomlinson and Brody's <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#97">[11]</a> argument is that physicians are, and should be, allowed to define what is reasonable because they have been empowered to do so by society in exchange for meeting the population's medical needs. This empowerment is made possible because, as members of a profession, physicians are expected to set high standards, hold all patients' interests in trust, and police themselves. However, society increasingly has questioned the moral authority, the willingness to treat all people, and the self-regulation of the medical profession. At the same time, the ethical principle of autonomy has come into more conflict with the principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence. Nowhere is this conflict more apparent than in recent case law.</p>

This case involved a 22-yr-old woman who was being maintained in a persistent vegetative state on a mechanical ventilator in a New Jersey hospital. When the hospital and Ms. Quinlan's physicians refused to remove the ventilator at her parents' request, her father petitioned the court to be named her guardian with the power to have the ventilator removed.

Having considered that Ms. Quinlan, if she had been capable of making medical decisions herself, would have forgone therapy, the court decided that her right to privacy would be abrogated if it prevented the exercise of that right on her behalf. The court therefore granted the father's petition, allowing him to exercise substituted judgment for his daughter. However, it did not address the issue of whether physicians could override patient or surrogate insistence that nonsentient life be maintained, because this was not Mr. Quinlan's desire.</p>

When her nephew and guardian sought permission to remove the tube on the grounds that this approach would have been his aunt's wish, the trial court agreed to his petition.

She was returned to Hennepin County Medical Center in a persistent vegetative state. In the summer of 1990, Mrs. Wanglie's physicians met with her husband and children and recommended that life-sustaining therapy, which was costing approximate $500,000 a year, be withdrawn. The husband said that the patient had never expressed her wishes regarding life support, but that he and the children insisted that therapy be continued because they valued life over death and because a miracle might occur.</p>

In 1991, after the family had tried and failed to find another facility willing to care for the patient, the Medical Center asked the court first to appoint an independent conservator to decide if ventilation was beneficial, and second, for a hearing to determine whether ventilation was required if the conservator held that it was not beneficial. Mr. Wanglie crossfiled, requesting that he be appointed conservator. The court agreed with his request on the grounds that he could best represent his wife's interests. Three days later, while receiving full support at the Medical Center, Mrs. Wanglie died. The court never addressed the question of whether physicians or the Medical Center could refuse to provide requested treatment, and thus, the conflict between nonmaleficence and beneficence and autonomy was not resolved.</p>

This case involved an anencephalic infant whose mother insisted that she receive mechanical ventilation whenever she had trouble breathing. Baby K's physicians disagreed, but they could not find another hospital willing to take their patient. Although Baby K ultimately was weaned from the ventilator and discharged to a nursing home, she required readmission on several occasions. Following her second readmission, the hospital sought court agreement that it was not required to provide mechanical ventilation. A federal judge ruled against the hospital, which in turn appealed the decision to the Fourth Circuit Court in Virginia. This appeal was based, in large part, on a Virginia statute stating that physicians are not required "to prescribe or render medical treatment'' they deem "medically or ethically inappropriate'' <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#103">[17]</a>.</p>

The federal Act, which was designed primarily to prevent patient "dumping,'' requires hospitals either to stabilize patients who seek emergency treatment or transfer them if absolutely necessary. The Appeals Court reasoned that Baby K had an emergency condition, namely, "bradypnea or apnea, not anencephaly,'' that the hospital was required to treat with mechanical ventilation. Thus, the issue of Baby K's treatment was decided on a strict reading of the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. Whether anencephalic infants should receive mechanical ventilation indefinitely, or whether other patients with similarly hopeless conditions should be supported, was not dealt with <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#103">[17]</a>.</p>

Yet, the decisions all fall short of resolving the ethical conflict between these principles.

This position is tenable because Mrs. Wanglie and Baby K were consuming critical care services, paid for in part by public dollars, that could have been used to support other patients, critically ill, or otherwise. In this regard, Miles <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#104">[18]</a>, an ethicist who advised the Hennepin County Medical Center in the Helen Wanglie case, noted that "In this case, the husband's request seemed entirely inconsistent with what medical care could do for his wife, the standards of the community, and his fair share of medical resources that many people pooled for their collective medical care.''</p>

Although these proposals differ, most of them are designed to provide access to basic health benefits, including preventive and primary care services, for all American citizens. The proposals also call for reducing the costs of health care through mechanisms such as global budgets and managed competition. Central to managed competition are managed care plans containing primary care physicians who restrict the use of expensive tests, therapies, and consultants, and who are reimbursed on a capitated rather than a fee-for-service basis.</p>

Rationing of medical services probably will be part of this reality, and such rationing is less unlikely to be based on the economic leverage and vocal insistence of a minority of patients and surrogates than it has been in the past. As Miles <a class="fulltext-RA" href="#104">[18]</a> pointed out in reference to the Helen Wanglie case, "We could not afford a universal health care system based on patients' demands.

<P><B>Objectives:<BR></B>We used hypertension as a model to study guideline 
implementation in primary care practice through a clinical decision support 
(CDS) system: ATHENA-HTN (hypertension). One objective was to evaluate the 
impact on primary care provider (PCP) prescribing in a clinical trial.</P>
<P><B>Methods:<BR></B>ATHENA-HTN presents patient-specific evidence-based 
recommendations for HTN management to primary care providers (PCPs) in an 
advisory window within CPRS. For patients whose blood pressure (BP) is only 
slightly above target (within 5mmHg), ATHENA-HTN recommends intensifying therapy 
if the BP remains high on repeated measurements. At 4 VAMCs, including 20 
substations (10 per study arm), with 76 PCPs (30 control arm, 46 intervention), 
of whom 38 each were MDs and nonMDs, we randomized by substation, stratified on 
station (medical center), PCPs’ average years at VA, and presence/absence of a 
pharmacist in the primary-care-clinics. We analyzed patient data extracted from 
the electronic health record (VistA). For patients with a BP above target at a 
visit with PCP (index visit), we identified which of the following events 
occurred FIRST during the year after the index visit: intensification of therapy 
(Event1), return of patient’s BP to below target (Event2), patient seen in 
clinic and BP either remained above target or was not measured (Event3, 
undesired event), or patient had neither a return primary care clinic visit nor 
a repeat BP (Event4, right-censoring). We compared mean proportions of events 
per PCP between study arms using mixed model regression adjusting for medical 
center, clinic type (CBOC or not), PCP MD vs non-MD, presence of pharmacist, and 
mean age of PCP’s panel of patients as fixed effects, and substation as a random 
effect to account for clustering of PCPs. We fit an initial model including all 
4 events and did not detect a difference between study arms for mean proportion 
of event 4; findings are based on denominator of event types 1-3.</P>
<P><B>Results:<BR></B>17,436 patient met study eligibility, of whom 5334 (30.6%) 
had an index visit with BP above target. For these 5334 patients, mean 
proportions of each event per PCP by study arm were Event1 25.4% control vs 
30.6% intervention (p &gt;0.1); Event2 59.6% vs 55.2.0%(p &gt;0.1); Event3 16.2% 
vs 13.7%(p &gt;0.1). A difference in mean proportions of Event1 between study 
arms was possibly suggested for the MD subgroup only (25.6% control vs 35.5% 
intervention, F = 4.14, p = 0.072). The mean proportion of Event1 declined in 
those panels that averaged over 70 years in age (p = 0.015). No significant 
association was detected between the remaining covariates and any of the 
outcomes (p &gt;0.6). For 2538/5334 patients (47.6%) with SBP &gt;5mmHg over 
target, mean proportions of each event per PCP by study arm for Event1 were 
33.6% control vs 41.0% intervention (p &gt;0.1), with a difference in mean 
proportions of Event1 between study arms for the MD subgroup only (33.1% control 
vs 46.2% intervention, F = 5.46, p = 0.048).</P>
<P><B>Implications:<BR></B>BP control overall was good, with almost 70% of 
patient having BP control at all clinic visits during the study period. 
Furthermore, among patients who did have a BP above target, more than half were 
only slightly above target, and almost 60% returned to a controlled BP without 
any intensification of drug therapy. For patients with an SBP more than slightly 
elevated, the CDS system led to higher rates of intensification by MDs. We also 
found that intensification occurred less often when the mean age of the panel of 
patients was older; possibly because older patients are more likely to have 
comorbid conditions that make intensification of drug therapy riskier.</P>
<P><B>Impacts:<BR></B>These findings support the need for quality measures for 
HTN that take account of individual patient factors, and for similarly 
individualized clinical decision 
support.</P></DIV><!--end content--></DIV></BODY></HTML>
